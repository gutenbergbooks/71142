<h3>I. RANULPH DE GLANVILLE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ranulph de Glanville</span> was born in the Suffolk Stratford, about 1130
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> He is believed to have been the son of Sir Hervey de
Glanville, Chamberlain to King Stephen, and the grandson of that
Ranulph de Glanville who came over with the Conqueror. The family was
an important one, owning much land in the counties of Suffolk and
Norfolk. Glanville’s public life began in 1164, when he was appointed
sheriff of Yorkshire; an office which he continued to hold for six
years. In 1171 he was appointed Governor of Richmond Castle, and in
1174, sheriff of Lancashire. The Scots having invaded England in that
year, he led the forces of Lancashire and Richmond against them, and
(joining the sheriff of Yorkshire and his forces) surprised and routed
the Scots at Alnwick, and took King William the Lion prisoner. For
this victory Glanville deserved, as he certainly received, the credit;
and from that time no man stood higher than he in the favor of King
Henry II. He was sheriff of Westmoreland from 1175 to 1179; sheriff of
Yorkshire a second time, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">-iv-</span> 1177 to his death; judge of the King’s
Court in 1176, and Chief Justiciar in 1180. He was also employed in
many distinguished public services. In 1177 he was sent as ambassador
to Flanders. In 1182 he led an army against the Welsh. In 1184, with
Archbishop Baldwin, he was sent as ambassador to Rice ap Griffin,
Prince of South Wales. In his next Welsh expedition, a few years later
(again with Baldwin), he preached a crusade. In 1186 he was ambassador
to the King of France, and was active in negotiating the peace of
Gisors. In 1189, while Henry was struggling with his rebellious sons
and with Philip of France in Normandy, he was sent to Canterbury to
treat with the Chapter; was soon again in Normandy with Henry; and
finally returned to England to raise an army for his master’s service,
a work in which he was engaged at the time of Henry’s death.</p>

<p>These great offices were due to his personal merit and to the great
services he rendered to his country; but they appear to have been the
result, also, of the personal friendship and affection of the King. He
was one of the witnesses to Henry’s will, and a trustee of the King’s
bequest of 5,000 marks of silver to certain religious and charitable
institutions, and of 300 marks of gold for marrying poor free women
of England. He was named by Henry as custodian of Queen Eleanor, and
as treasurer of his private fortune. A pretty picture of the King’s
feeling toward him occurs in the account of the arrival of Glanville’s
messenger in London, after the battle of Alnwick.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">-v-</span> The messenger
arrived at midnight and insisted on seeing the King. Being admitted to
the royal chamber he boldly approached the King’s bed and roused him
from sleep. He, springing up, cried, “Who is it?” “I am the messenger
of Ranulph of Glanville, your faithful subject, and I come from him
to your highness as a bearer of good tidings.” “Is our Ranulph well?”
cried the King, moved less by the promised good tidings than by his
love for the sender of them. “My lord is well,” was the answer, “and he
holds your enemy, the King of the Scots, a prisoner at Richmond.”</p>

<p>Upon the death of Henry, Glanville’s position was a difficult one.
Henry, conservative, though a reformer, had established the government
of his kingdom on a foundation of law and justice, and had created an
effective and pure administrative machine. The new King appeared to
have no sympathy with his father’s principles of government. He was
rash, radical and careless of regular details of administration, and
Glanville, in the words of a contemporary, “In his old age saw the King
doing many things in a newfangled way, without wisdom or forethought.”
He was present at the coronation of Richard, and was sent by him to
quell a riot against the Jews which disgraced the ceremony. About his
next acts we have different accounts. He had taken the cross in 1186.
Whether he asked and received his dismissal from Richard in order to
join the army, then about to start for the Holy Land, or whether, as
another account has it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">-vi-</span> he was removed and imprisoned by Richard and
obliged to purchase his freedom by a fine of 15,000 pounds of silver,
we cannot certainly tell. At any rate, he set out for Palestine
together with Baldwin, Archbishop of Canterbury, and his nephew Hubert,
then bishop of Salisbury; the three were placed in command of the
English forces by Richard (who was obliged to delay his own departure),
and Glanville in 1190 died before Acre, by disease, the result of the
unhealthy climate. He left one son and three daughters, whom he had
already enriched from his great fortune. He founded the priory of
Butley, the Abbey of Leiston, and a hospital at Somerton.</p>

<p>Glanville impressed his contemporaries as a man strong both in body and
in mind. A man of integrity and prudence, “most faithful in fortune
or misfortune,” “Wise, grave and eloquent,” “The King’s eye;” “A name
above every name, who spoke among the princes and was adored by the
people.” He was a man wise, just and charitable, whose fellowship was
sought and opinions valued by wits and by scholars. One scandal only
attacked him. He is charged with falsely condemning to death for rape
Sir Gilbert de Plumpton, in order that his widow might be married
to Glanville’s friend and steward, Rainer; Sir Gilbert’s punishment
was commuted by the King to imprisonment for life. The tale is quite
inconsistent with all we know of Glanville’s character and with his
position in the King’s affection, and may safely be disbelieved.</p>

<p>His family shared in his success. No less than seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">-vii-</span> of his near
relatives held high judicial position under Henry or his sons. Few
other families have rendered greater service to England than that of
Ranulph de Glanville, ambassador, administrator, general, judge and
jurist.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Incidents of Glanville’s life and character are reported
in all the chroniclers of the time. Especially valuable
are the accounts in Hoveden, Benedictus Abbas, Giraldus
Cambrensis, Newburgh, Richard of Devizes, and Diceto. The
fullest modern sketch of his life is by Professor Maitland,
in the Dictionary of National Biography. Other modern
biographies are those of Foss (Judges of England, i, 376);
Thomas Wright (Biographia Britannica, 275); Lord Campbell
(Lives of the Chief Justices, i, 19); and Professor Gross
(Sources and Literature of English History, 315).</p>

<p>Many interesting documents bearing on Glanville’s genealogy
and his property are printed in Glanville-Richards’
“Records of the Anglo-Norman House of Glanville.”]</p>

<h3>II. THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE TREATISE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following “Treatise on the Laws and Customs of the Kingdom of
England,” was published between 1187 and 1189; it mentions a fine made
in the former year, and it is filled with references to Henry, as then
King. It had a high contemporary reputation. Copies of the book were
multiplied, and many manuscripts still exist. It forms part of several
collections of laws made by contemporaries of Glanville himself. It
was translated, or partly translated, into French immediately after
Glanville’s death, and it was revised and an attempt made to bring
it down to date two generations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">-viii-</span> later. It was finally superseded by
Bracton’s completer and more elaborate treatise.</p>

<p>The work itself is anonymous, the manuscripts stating only that it was
composed in the time of Henry II., “Glanville then holding the helm
of justice.” Early tradition, however, asserts that it was written by
Glanville himself, and that fact was accepted as undoubted from the
thirteenth to the nineteenth century. Modern scholars have expressed
doubt of it. Littleton’s objection (in his “Life of Henry II.”) that
Glanville could not have written the book because he was not in orders,
may be dismissed at once. The greater officers of the administration,
whether in orders or not, must have had sufficient Latin to dictate a
Latin treatise to a clerk, and Glanville was particularly commended for
his eloquence by more than one contemporary. Hunter’s objection (in the
preface to his “Fines”) is that Glanville, at the time the treatise was
written, was too busy in public affairs to have composed such a work,
and he suggests that the author may have been William de Glanville, a
justice in the next reign; who was, in fact, Glanville’s son, and (from
1186) his secretary. But this is the merest guess. Professor Maitland
conjectures (for a rather fanciful reason, perhaps) that the author
may have been Hubert Walter. Liebermann, on the other hand, defends
Glanville’s authorship. Certainly there is little external proof that
Glanville was the author of the treatise, though it must have been
written by some one in high position and repute to have obtained so
immediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">-ix-</span> a success. The internal evidence does not lead us much
further. The style is that of a person speaking with authority, but not
necessarily the authority of the Chief Justiciar himself. The claim of
Hubert Walter to the authorship cannot be dismissed without further
examination.</p>

<p>Hubert was a nephew of Glanville’s wife; according to one account,
of Glanville himself, Glanville’s younger brother having married his
wife’s sister. Whether Hervey Walter, Hubert’s father, was really, as
this account has it, Hervey de Glanville or not, it is certain that
Hubert was brought up in intimacy with Glanville’s family, became his
secretary, and was regarded by him as a valued counsellor. He was made
Dean of York in 1186, being succeeded as secretary by Glanville’s son
William. He soon became Bishop of Salisbury, Archbishop of Canterbury,
and later Chief Justiciar and Chancellor of the Kingdom. He is
described as a man of foresight and wisdom; it is said of him that his
heart was in human affairs rather than divine, and that he knew all
the laws of the kingdom. He was, however, a man “of little eloquence;”
indeed, one chronicler ridicules his Latin style.</p>

<p>Did Glanville write the whole treatise? or did Hubert Walter write
it? Or did they collaborate on it? Perhaps we can reach a conjectural
conclusion by a more careful examination of the treatise itself.</p>

<p>The most striking feature of the treatise is, that it is based upon a
collection of writs. Omitting the <a href="#PREFACE">Introduction</a> and the <a href="#Book_XIV">last book</a>, on
Pleas of the Crown, just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">-x-</span> one-third of the chapters into which it is
divided consists of writs. These are of all kinds, directed to Lords’
Courts, to County Courts, and to Ecclesiastical Courts, as well as
writs returnable in the King’s Courts. Later writers have made free
use of writs, but here they are the skeleton of the whole treatise.
They fulfil the function of judgment-rolls in Bracton’s book, and of
decisions in Coke and later writers. The collection of these eighty
writs must have been a work of several years, since some of the writs
were certainly of rare occurrence. The Chief Justice, or his clerk,
attested all the writs, and either of them had both opportunity and
reason for making such a collection; hardly another man in the kingdom
would have been likely to do it.</p>

<p>A large part of the treatise is written in a crabbed and inelegant,
though usually a clear style. In a few passages, however, near the
beginning of the book, we find an elevation of thought and elegance of
diction often admired and imitated. The <a href="#PREFACE">Introduction</a>, in particular,
and the <a href="#BOOK2_CHAP_VII">seventh chapter of the second book</a>, in praise of the assize
(which, according to tradition, Glanville had a hand in inventing,
or, at least, in establishing), are worthy of a man “<span lang="la">sapiens simul
et eloquens</span>”; in sharp contrast with other parts of the work, which
indicate an author who “<span lang="la">omnia regni novit jura</span>,” but was surely “<span lang="la">non
eloquio pollens</span>.”</p>

<p>The first ten books of the treatise are carefully written, the
commentary is full, the subject well developed. The last four books,
on the other hand, seem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">-xi-</span> to have been hurriedly thrown together. The
proportion of writ to text is more than twice that in the preceding
books; indeed, in the book devoted to the County Courts (in which
Glanville had presided for years, and must have become as familiar with
the law and procedure as with those of the King’s Courts), there is
almost no comment. It seems possible that a proposed full commentary on
the County Court practice, for which an elaborate collection of writs
was at hand, was abandoned.</p>

<p>The exact date of the work is fixed by the only two dated documents—two
fines, of June 27 and about November 1, 1187. Fines were then novel,
and they were described carefully. It seems likely that the passage,
which occurs toward the end of the treatise, was written soon after the
dates of enrollment. Both fines were enrolled in Glanville’s presence.</p>

<p>We may now conjecture that the author, or authors, of the treatise had
for years been collecting writs, either for preservation as useful
precedents, or possibly with the object of composing a commentary upon
them. The collection finished, it would not be a matter of much time
or difficulty for one who knew the law, writs in hand, to dictate his
commentary to a secretary also learned in the law. If the collector was
Glanville, and the secretary Hubert, we may suppose that the actual
work of composition was begun in 1185, or 1186; not, apparently, a
time of strenuous labor for either. Passages of particular importance
or of especial interest to Glanville would be composed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">-xii-</span> him with
care; the actual form of the remainder might safely be left to his
competent secretary, subject only to revision by himself. In 1186
the Dean of York died, and the succession was given to Hubert; and
Glanville soon set out on his embassy to the King of France. In spite
of this, however, time still remained for the completion of the work in
the rather less polished form of the later books. In February, 1187,
Glanville and Hubert were sitting together in the Court at Westminster;
and from that month to the beginning of 1189 (with the exception of
Lent, 1188, when Glanville was preaching his crusade in Wales), both
appear to have remained in England, without serious interruption from
public business. The year 1188, in fact, seems to have been one of
the least busy of Glanville’s official life; and, until his time was
absorbed by the troubles of the closing year of the reign, there was
nothing to prevent a continuance of the work. The last hurried chapters
may well, therefore, have been completed in 1188.</p>

<p>There is, then, nothing against the early and persistent tradition that
Glanville wrote the treatise, and much in its favor; though most of the
actual composition may have been the work of Hubert Walter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The fullest discussion of the authorship of “Glanville”
may be found in Pollock and Maitland’s “History of the
English Law,” i, 163. Reeves’ discussion (“History of the
English Law,” Finlayson’s Edition, i, 254) and Foss’s
(“Judges of England,” i, 180) are also worth consulting
upon this point. Liebermann (“<span lang="de">Einleitung</span>,” p. 73)
supports the theory of Glanville’s authorship; and in the
“<span lang="de">Zeitschrift für romanische Philologie</span>,” xix,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">-xiii-</span> 81, he gives
interesting proof of the early popularity of the treatise.

<h3>III. THE CHARACTER OF THE TREATISE.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">A Treatise</span> on the Law and Customs of the Kingdom of England” is the
earliest systematic treatise on law written in modern times. A few
collections of law and decretals, like the <i><span lang="la">Decretum</span></i> of Gratian
and the “Assises of Jerusalem,” had, to be sure, been published
earlier; but they were not, like this book, regular expositions of an
existing system of law. Bracton’s work was modelled on Glanville, and,
through Bracton, Glanville thus fixed the type of the modern commentary
on law. An imitation, in many parts an exact copy, of this book was
later published in Scotland under the title “<span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span>,” and
the claim was vigorously made for a time that it was the original,
Glanville the imitation. This notion, improbable on its face, was
absolutely disproved by arguments set forth in Beames’ <a href="#INTRODUCTION">Introduction</a>.</p>

<p>The first edition of the treatise was printed by R. Tottel in small
12mo, about the year 1554. Coke says that this was done by suggestion
of Sir William Stanford, the learned judge and author. The second
edition was printed by Thomas Wright in 1604. The text was corrected
by the collation of “various manuscripts.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">-xiv-</span> This edition was exactly
reprinted, omitting the <a href="#PREFACE">preface</a>, in 1673. The treatise was again
printed in the first volume of Houard’s “<i><span lang="fr">Traités sur les Coutumes
Anglo-Normandes</span></i>” in quarto, Rouen, 1776. The last Latin edition was
published by John Rayner, 8vo, 1780, collated with the Bodleian, the
Cottonian, the Harleian and Doctor Milles’s manuscripts by J.E. Wilmot.
The Latin text is also printed as an appendix to Phillips’s “<span lang="de">Englische
Reichs und Rechtsgeschichte</span>,” ii, 335: Berlin, 1828. A collation of
Glanville with the “<span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span>” may be found in the Acts of the
Parliament of Scotland, i, 133. An English translation by John Beames,
with notes, was published in octavo, London, 1812, and is reprinted in
the present edition.</p>

<p>This treatise is more than a mere law book. It is a monument to the
genius of one of the greatest legal reformers of all time. Henry II.
came to the throne, after a long period of anarchy, to find countless
systems of law administered by a confused and confusing mass of popular
courts and feudal courts. He at once set himself to bring order and
unity out of anarchy and chaos. He made the King’s Court the common
court of the land; he determined its jurisdiction as against the
church, the lords and the sheriffs; and he made it the guardian of a
King’s peace, which should protect high and low throughout the whole
land. The establishment of peace was in fact the chief object of his
stormy career. Glanville’s treatise shows us the method he took to
secure his object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">-xv-</span></p>

<p>By a free use of writs running from the King or his Justiciar, he
limited the jurisdiction of all other courts, and subordinated them to
the King’s Court. By a regular system of removal from lord to county,
and from county to King, he secured the gradual unification of the
law. The lord’s courts had administered the customs of each manor;
each county court, too, had its customs, all based upon the Germanic
law, but differing materially in the several counties, and especially
in the several ancient divisions of the kingdom. The King’s Court now
began to develop a common law, partly Anglo-Saxon in its origin, partly
Norman, but molded largely by Henry’s formal or informal legislation,
and tempered, as Glanville several times asserts, by equity.</p>

<p>To increase the influence of the King’s courts and to bring them to
the people, Henry relied on an already existing institution, the
<i><span lang="la">iter</span></i> or eyre; but he so improved the system as to make it almost
a new invention. The Kingdom was divided into circuits, each made up
of a number of neighboring counties; and judges were appointed to
ride each circuit, holding a King’s court in each county, and thus
bringing every part of the Kingdom under the direct control of the
King. Glanville himself became one of the first judges of the Northern
Circuit.</p>

<p>One of the most important of Henry’s provisions for securing the King’s
peace was the invention of writs for the protection of peaceful seisin,
and the prevention of disseisin, even by the true owner. These writs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">-xvi-</span>
put an end to forcible self-help, and brought every legal dispute over
dispossession into the King’s Court. The writs of novel disseisin, of
mort d’auncestor, and of darrein presentment, established by Henry’s
legislation, became the basis of the land law.</p>

<p>Another reform, of even more far-reaching consequence, was his
invention of a more rational method of establishing the truth of facts.
In place of trial by ordeal, by compurgation, or by battle, he provided
the assise (soon followed by the jury) as a means of eliciting truth.
Trial by jury in the King’s Court, by favor or by right, became so
popular as eventually to deprive the other courts of their litigation;
and so satisfactory as to cultivate in the people of England a respect
for law and a willingness to abide by its decisions that have been
characteristic of the race for centuries.</p>

<p>The doctrine of res judicata seems to have been adopted at this time
as another rule tending to the preservation of peace. When Glanville
wrote, it had not been fully settled that the judgment even in a writ
of right was necessarily final; Glanville’s strong opinion that it was
so no doubt settled the law as we now have it.</p>

<p>In the work of reform Henry appears to have found in Glanville an
enthusiastic and an able helper. This treatise is full of praise of
the King and his legislation. The peaceful governing of its people is
a great object of regal power, it is asserted. The king, who loves
peace and is the author of it, conducts himself justly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">-xvii-</span> discreetly,
and mercifully toward his subjects. His will is law, if promulgated as
such by the advice of his nobles; that and reasonable customs, long
used, form the Laws of England, which may usefully, in part at least,
be reduced to writing.</p>


<h3>IV. THE TREATISE AND THE LAW.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is possible from Glanville’s treatise to get a rather complete
picture of the common law at the end of the reign of Henry II. In the
lord’s courts were regularly brought not only the suits of the villein
tenants, but all suits concerning land held of the lord. Suits of
the latter sort, however, must be begun by the King’s writ; if the
lord refused justice, resort might be had to the county court in all
suits involving freehold land; and the lord might on his own motion
adjourn a question of difficulty into the King’s court. The county
court had original jurisdiction of questions of villeinage and of
customary service, and of any question sent to it by the King’s writ;
and it had jurisdiction over writs of right removed from the lord’s
court. It apparently, also, had jurisdiction of disputes as to title
or possession of personal property. The ecclesiastical courts had
jurisdiction of questions of marriage and legitimacy, of wills, and
of disputes involving ecclesiastical questions only; the King’s court
would prohibit them by writ from interfering in other matters.</p>

<p>The procedure in the King’s court did not differ greatly from the
present procedure. A suit was begun by writ, served by the sheriff,
and enforced by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">-xviii-</span> distraint of the defendant’s land. The most
important feature of the procedure was the elaborate system of rules
governing <i>essoins</i> or continuances. By a skilful use of essoins
the defendant or tenant could prolong proceedings on a writ of right
for years; the fact that in the new possessory assises few essoins were
allowed, and the proceedings were therefore much prompter, contributed
greatly to the favor with which they were received. Final judgment in
the King’s court was by this time enrolled; and the method of conveying
land by levying a fine was in full operation.</p>

<p>The law of real property in its essential features was fully formed.
The whole law of tenures and incidents had been finally settled; but
the rules of inheritance and of transfer by will were still uncertain.
The doctrines of warranty (now obsolete), according to which the
grantor of a party could be called into a suit, or in the technical
phrase vouched to warranty, and thus substituted for the original
party, were still of the highest importance in practice. The modern
mortgage, i.e. the grant on condition, was as yet unknown: Glanville’s
mortgage of land, like the pledge of personalty in his time, is a mere
grant of custody by way of security.</p>

<p>The law of personal property was little developed. Doctrines as to
pledge and bailment, derived from the old Germanic law, were applied
in the county courts; there, for instance, the absolute responsibility
of the bailee was still enforced. Through the writ of detinue and
the action on the case, the King’s courts were soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">-xix-</span> to take control
of these subjects, and to establish the modern law of bailments and
carriers.</p>

<p>Certain formal contracts were enforced by the King’s court. The writ
of debt would lie as a result of a loan, a sale, or an obligation
created by charter. Redress for breach of ordinary contracts could be
obtained only in the ecclesiastical courts, which might deal with the
sin of deceit. Not for three centuries did the King’s court work out a
doctrine by which a party might be held to perform his simple contract.</p>

<p>No action of damages for tort would lie. There is as yet no trace
of the process by which (working from appeals of felony to writ of
trespass against the King’s peace and actions on the case) the King’s
court would eventually work out the modern law of tort. So far as there
was any remedy for torts it was in the inferior courts.</p>

<p>The King’s court could at this time punish all felonies except theft,
jurisdiction over which it obtained by Magna Carta. It was a long time
before it obtained exclusive jurisdiction over felony, or took control,
as “custos morum,” of misdemeanors.</p>

<p>Such law, it may be admitted, was rude and unsatisfactory; but it was
a long advance over what had gone before, and it had within itself the
germ of the modern Common Law.</p>

<p><span class="xlg"><b>O</b></span><span class="smcap">f Ranulph de Glanville</span>, the reputed Author of the following Treatise,
Lord Coke speaks in terms of the highest encomium. He informs us, that
Glanville was Chief Justice in the Reign of Henry the Second, that he
wrote profoundly on part of the Laws of England, and that his Works
were extant at that day. “And,” continues his Lordship, “in token of
my thankfulness to that worthy Judge, whom I cite many times in these
Reports, (as I have done in my former) for the fruit which I confess
myself to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">-xxi-</span> have reaped out of the fair field of his Labors, I will
for the honor of him and of his name and posterity, which remain to
this day (as I have good cause to know) impart and publish, both to
all future and succeeding Ages, what I found of great antiquity and of
undoubted verity, the original whereof remaineth with me at this day,
and followeth in these words: <i><span lang="la">Ranulphus de Glanvilla, Justiciarius
Angliæ, Fundator fuit domus de Butteley, in Comitatu Suffolciæ, quæ
fundata erat anno Regis Henrici, filii Imperatricis, decimo septimo, et
anno Domini 1171. quo anno Thomas Becket, Cantuariensis Archiepiscopus,
erat occisus. Et dictus Ranulphus nascebatur in Villa de Stratford, in
comitatu Suffolciæ, et habuit Manerium de Benhall, cum toto Dominio,
e dono dicti Regis Henrici. Et duxit in uxorem quandam Bertam, filiam
Domini Theobaldi de Valeymz, Senioris domini de Parham: qui Theobaldus
per Chartam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">-xxii-</span> suam dedit dicto Ranulpho et Bertæ Uxori suæ totam
terram de Brochous, cum pertinentiis, in qua domus de Butteley sita
est, cum aliis terris et tenementis, in libero maritagio. Prædictus
vero Ranulphus procreavit tres filias de dicta Berta (viz.) Matildam,
Amabiliam, et Helewisam, quibus dedit terram suam ante progressum
suum versus Terram Sanctam.</span></i>” The document then proceeds with a
minute accuracy to trace our Author’s Descendants, and finishes the
sketch by informing us—“<i><span lang="la">quod præfatus Ranulphus de Glanvilla fuit
vir præclarissimus genere, utpote de nobili sanguine, vir insuper
strenuissimus corpore, qui provectiori ætate, ad Terram sanctam
properavit, et ibidem contra inimicos Crucis Christi strenuissime usque
ad necem dimicavit</span></i>.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The paucity of these facts may be, in some
measure, remedied, by consulting the Annals of our Second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">-xxiii-</span> Henry,
where the name of Glanville not unfrequently occurs. We hear of him
in 1171, as Fermour of the Honor of Earl Conan:<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>—in 1172, as having
the custody of that Honor, and the Fair of Hoiland;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>—and in 1174,
as still retaining the same Honor, and accounting for the Capture and
Ransoms of Prisoners, &amp;c. taken in War.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the latter year he is
said to have distinguished himself, as the General who took the King
of Scotland Prisoner.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In 1175, he still retained the Honor of Earl
Conan,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and filled the Office of Sheriff of Yorkshire.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In 1176, he
was made a Justice of the King’s Court, and a Justice Itinerant.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In
the same year, he accounted for Westmoreland by the hands of Reiner,
his Dapifer or Steward, a privilege conceded to the great alone.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">-xxiv-</span> In
1180, he was made Chief Justiciary of all England, as we are informed
by his cotemporary Roger Hoveden, whose words are too remarkable to
be omitted. <i><span lang="la">Henricus Rex Angliæ pater constituit Ranulphum de
Glanvilla summum Justiciarium totius Angliæ, cujus sapientia conditæ
sunt leges subscriptæ, quas Anglicanas vocamus.</span></i><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The Chief
Justiciary, presided in the <i><span lang="la">Curia Regis</span></i> next to the King, as
Chief Judge in all civil and criminal questions; and governed the Realm
like a Vice-Roy, when the King was beyond Sea, an event of frequent
recurrence in that age. In fine, this officer was invested with a
power that placed him far above every other subject. No sooner had
Glanville arrived at this elevated post, than he exerted himself to
restore and confirm many ancient Laws calculated for the good of the
Realm.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> How much to the satisfaction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">-xxv-</span> Henry the Second Glanville
filled this arduous situation, we may infer, from finding additional
honors heaped upon him by that able and politic Prince. In 1183, our
Author held the place of Dapifer to the King,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and, in the same
year, he was appointed Fermour of Yorkshire:<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> situations, it is to
be presumed, not incompatible with that of Chief Justiciary, which he
appears to have retained, until the death of Henry the Second,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and
that with undiminished honor, if we except the imputation cast upon
him for condemning Sir Gilbert de Plumptun to death, but which seems
to be refuted by the confidence continued to be reposed in him by the
discerning Henry.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Immediately after the death of that Prince, he
assumed the Order of the Cross, and perished fighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">-xxvi-</span> valiantly at the
Siege of Acon in the year 1190.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>But, whether the same identical person successively occupied these
various situations, and, at different periods of his life, filled the
rather opposite and inconsistent characters of an able General and a
profound Lawyer—a skilful Courtier and an enlightened Legislator, is
a doubt which has been entertained by some very respectable Writers.
Nor has it passed without a question, whether the present Treatise was
really composed by the person whose name it bears. Lord Littleton,
indeed, is inclined to infer, that it was not written by Glanville,
but by some Clergyman under his direction.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> These doubts may serve
to evince the ingenuity of those who have suggested them, but they
prove nothing. When the various situations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvii">-xxvii-</span> Glanville is stated to have
filled are represented as incompatible, and we start at beholding the
grave Lawyer divest himself of his robes to girt on the armour of the
soldier, we forget the manners of the age when Glanville florished.
When we suppose, that because the work is composed in Latin, it was not
written by a Layman, we beg the question: and, having assumed, that no
Layman, whatever his parts, whatever his application, could have been
sufficiently skilled to write such Latin as our Author has employed, we
pay but a sorry compliment to the age, and rather too hastily conclude
that we have proved, what, indeed, we have merely taken for granted.
When, in fine, we infer, that the knowledge of Law displayed in the
Work, and the labor consumed in composing it, are no less inconsistent
with the high and elevated station of Glanville, than incompatible with
his employments, we forget, that his rise was progressive, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxviii">-xxviii-</span> that,
as there are but few things to which a truly great mind is inadequate,
the production of a small volume upon that Law which it was daily in
the habit of dispensing, ought not, whatever the merit of the work
may be, to be ranked amongst the number. It must not, however, be
concealed, that Mr. Selden mentions a circumstance which, at the first
glance, appears to go a great way in determining the question. “I know
the authority of that Treatise,” says he, in speaking of the present
work, “is suspected, and some of the best and ancientest copies having
the name of <i>E. de N.</i> which I have heard from diligent searchers
in this kind of Learning affirmed to have been sometimes <i>E. de
Narbrough</i>, and not <i>R. de Glanvilla</i>, it hath been thought to
be another’s work, and of later time. But as, on the other side, I dare
not be confident that it is Glanville’s, so I make little question,
that it is as ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxix">-xxix-</span> as his time, if not his work. The <i><span lang="la">teste</span></i>
of the precedents of writs under his name, the language, especially
the name of <i><span lang="la">Justitia</span></i> always for that which we now from ancient
time called <i><span lang="la">Justiciarius</span></i>, (and <i><span lang="la">Justitia</span></i> was so used in
writers under Henry the Second) and the Law delivered in it tasteth
not of any later age.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Though the latter part of this Extract may
be reasonably thought to furnish a sufficient answer to the doubt
expressed in the former part, the Translator cannot but observe upon
the singularity, that none “of the best and ancientest copies” are
forthcoming in support of the fact they are said to prove.</p>

<p>With respect to the Work itself now submitted to the Public in an
English dress, it is said to be the first performance that has
any thing like the appearance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxx">-xxx-</span> a Treatise on the subject of
Jurisprudence, since the dissolution of the Roman Empire.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> But
this is not correct, if the Assises of Jerusalem, compiled, as we are
informed in the preamble, in 1099—the System of Feudal Law, composed by
the two Milanese Lawyers in 1150, and the <i><span lang="la">Decretum</span></i> of Gratian,
published about the same time, be considered as Treatises on Law. It
seems, however, to be unquestionable, that the present Treatise is the
earliest and most ancient work on the subject of English Jurisprudence,
from which any clear and coherent account of it is to be obtained.
Dr. Robertson, indeed, informs us, “that in no country of Europe was
there at that time, any collection of Customs, nor had any attempt
been made to render Law fixed. The first undertaking of that kind was
by Glanville, Lord Chief Justice of England, in his <i><span lang="la">Tractatus de
Legibus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxi">-xxxi-</span> et consuetudinibus</span></i>,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> composed about the Year 1181.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>It has been thought, that Glanville drew up this compendium of the Laws
of England for the public use, by the express command of Henry the
Second, a conjecture which, Mr. Madox observes, is not only favored
by a certain MS. remaining in the Library of <i><span lang="la">Corpus Christi</span></i>
College, Cambridge, written in a hand of the age of Edward the Second,
in which there is a Treatise entituled <i><span lang="la">Leges Henrici Secundi</span></i>,
agreeing in many passages with the printed copy of Glanville, but also
by the manner of our Author’s writing, especially in the Prologue.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
There is also in the Cottonian collection a MS. of Glanville, which
bears the Title of <i>Laws of Henry the Second</i>. But Mr. Reeves
informs us, this manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxii">-xxxii-</span> of entituling Treatises was not then
uncommon.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The present work appears to have remained in MS. until the Year 1554,
when, as Sir Edward Coke apprises us, it was, by the persuasion and
procurement of Sir William Stanford, a grave and learned Judge of the
common Pleas, first printed.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> With many peculiar circumstances,
however, to create an Interest in its favor, the fate of the work
has been most singular. Indebted to its intrinsic merit alone for
the high compliment it has long enjoyed, in being looked up to as an
authority from which there was no appeal, curiosity has given way to
an opinion, that whilst it was venerable for its antiquity, it was
also useless, for it was obsolete. That many parts of it are obsolete,
it would be idle to deny; but that the work itself is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiii">-xxxiii-</span> by no means
so entirely obsolete as generally assumed, will be fully evident to
every impartial and candid Reader. But were it entirely obsolete, it
would not necessarily follow, that it would be useless, the terms not
being, at least in the science of Jurisprudence, either convertible
or synonymous, however fashionable, or, more properly speaking,
convenient it may be to esteem them such. <i><span lang="la">Multa ignoramus quæ nobis
non laterent, si Veterum lectio nobis esset familiaris.</span></i> The Law
of Modern Times is intimately connected with that of our Forefathers,
and the decisions of the present day are not unfrequently built upon
principles that are enveloped in the almost impervious mist of far
distant ages. But to these principles must the Student ascend, if he
would merit the name of a Lawyer; and, if the labor be severe, he must
reconcile it to himself by reflecting, that it was submitted to by a
Coke, a Hale, a Blackstone. Led by the soundness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiv">-xxxiv-</span> their judgments,
to investigate the earlier ages of our Jurisprudence, those great men
considered nothing useless, though it possibly might happen to be
obsolete, which tended to enlighten their minds, and shew them the
fundamental principles of those Laws, which they afterwards no less
admirably illustrated, than ably administered. But the brightness of
the example instead of exciting emulation seems to have depressed it:
and Glanville, Bracton, and Fleta have been suffered to crumble on the
shelf, whilst Edition has rapidly followed Edition of those more modern
Authors, who have advocated their cause, by drawing so deeply from the
rich and inexhaustible mines, which their pages present to the English
Lawyer.</p>

<p>It remains to speak of the Translation now submitted to the Public.
Fidelity has been the principal object of the Translator. If more be
demanded, he would shelter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxv">-xxxv-</span> himself under the high name of Sir William
Jones. “Elegance, on a subject so delicate as Law, must be sacrificed,
without mercy, to exactness.” Next to fidelity, simplicity has been
aimed at, as most in unison with the original, and, perhaps, the best
adapted for transfusing its spirit into the English Language. Not
that with these two objects immediately before him, the Translator
would be understood as conceding, that he has sacrificed any beauty,
any elegance of expression generally abounding in, or spread over,
the original work. He could not sacrifice that which never existed.
The style of Glanville, destitute of every grace, and dry and harsh
in the extreme, professedly aims at the peculiar qualities which
characterise it. <i><span lang="la">Stilo vulgari et verbis curialibus utens ex
industria, ad notitiam comparandum eis, qui hujusmodi vulgaritate minus
sunt exercitati</span></i>, are the very terms in which he describes his own
manner of writing. So successfully has he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvi">-xxxvi-</span> accomplished his object,
that he imposes upon his Translator a Task not altogether unlike that
of acquiring a new language. Yet to these difficulties the Translator
reluctantly alludes, for though they may, in some measure, atone for
those errors into which he is apprehensive he has often fallen, he
is conscious, the merit of his attempt is not to be estimated by its
arduousness, but its utility.</p>

<p>With respect to the Annotations, it was the Translator’s original
intention to have confined himself to a mere explanation of the
obsolete Terms. But, anxious to render the work more extensively
useful, he has not unfrequently departed from his first design. Among
the works occasionally referred to, the Reader will recognise the
<span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span>—so termed from the words with which it commences.
This work has been sometimes received, as containing the genuine
ancient Law of Scotland—sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvii">-xxxvii-</span> rejected, as a mere spurious
fabrication. Among the names in collision on this point are those of
Skene, Erskine, Lord Kaims, Houard, Dalrymple, Craig, Lord Stair and
Dr. Robertson. Nor has there been less dispute whether Glanville, or
the <span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span> be the original work. But this question is said
to be satisfactorily disposed of by Mr. Davidson, who has published a
pamphlet expressly on the subject, and has proved, if it were necessary
to prove, what is rendered indubitable by the internal Evidence of the
two Works, that Glanville is the original; observing, at the same time,
“that Glanville is regular, methodical, and consistent throughout;
whereas the <span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span> goes out of Glanville’s method for no
other assignable reason, than to disguise the matter, and is thereby
rendered confused, unsystematical, and in many places contradictory.”
The Translator has not been able to meet with Mr. Davidson’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxviii">-xxxviii-</span> work, but
is indebted to the <a href="#PREFACE">preface</a> attached to the last Edition of Glanville
for this Summary of it. “To this observation upon the method of the
<span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span>,” says Mr. Reeves, “it may be added, that, on a
comparison of the account given of things in that and in Glanville,
it plainly appears, that the Scotch Author is more clear, explicit,
and defined; and that he writes very often with a view to explain the
other, in the same manner in which the writer of our Fleta, explains
his predecessor Bracton. This is remarkable in numberless instances
all through the Book, and is, perhaps, as decisive a mark of a copy as
can be. The other Scotch Laws, which follow the <span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span> in
Skene’s collection, contribute greatly to confirm the suspicion. These,
as they are of a later date than several English Statutes which they
resemble, must be admitted to be copied from them; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxix">-xxxix-</span> so closely are
the originals followed, that the very words of them are retained. This
is particularly remarkable of the Reign of Robert the Second, in which
is the Statute of <i><span lang="la">quia Emptores</span></i>, and others plainly copied from
our Laws, without any attempt to conceal the imitation. These Laws,
at least, can impose upon no one; and when viewed with the Regiam
Majestatem at their head, and compared with Glanville and the English
Statute Book, they seem to declare very intelligibly to the world, that
this piece of Scotch Jurisprudence is borrowed from ours.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Nor is
the enlightened and liberal Historian Dr. Robertson more favorably
disposed towards that claim, which some of his countrymen have put in,
for the originality of the <span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span>. “The <span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span>
ascribed to David the first seems,” he observes, “to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xl">-xl-</span> be an imitation
and a servile one, of Glanville. Several Scottish Antiquaries, under
the influence of that pious credulity, which disposes men to assent
without hesitation to whatever they deem for the honor of their native
country, contend zealously, that the <span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span> is a production
prior to the Treatise of Glanville; and have brought themselves to
believe, that a nation, in a superior state of improvement, borrowed
its Laws from one considerably less advanced in its political progress.
The internal Evidence (were it my province to examine it) by which
this theory might be refuted is in my opinion decisive. The external
circumstances, which have seduced Scottish Authors into this mistake,
have been explained with so much precision and candor by Sir David
Dalrymple, in his Examination of some of the arguments for the high
antiquity of the <span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span>, Eding, 1767.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xli">-xli-</span> 4to, that it is to be
hoped, the controversy will not be again revived.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>In dismissing this subject, it may be remarked in the words of Mr.
Reeves, that it seems unnecessary to contend for the originality
of the <span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span>, whilst a doubt of much more importance
remains unsettled—whether that Treatise, as well as the others in the
publication of Skene, are now, or ever were, any part of the Law of
Scotland, on which, as we have already observed, so many eminent men
differ. On the other hand, the authenticity of Glanville, as the code
of Law existing in this country during the Reign of Henry the Second,
has been admitted, either expressly or impliedly by all the English
Lawyers, who have florished in the long interval which has elapsed from
that period to the present, and never has been questioned, if we except
a solitary <i>dictum</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlii">-xlii-</span> which, as it equally affected the credit
of Bracton, and was totally unauthorised, is refuted by a thousand
circumstances, if it were an object to mention them.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> But to return
from this digression.</p>

<p>Though the Translator had not the good fortune to meet with Mr.
Davidson’s Pamphlet, he was more successful in discovering Skene’s
translation of the <span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span>, deposited in Lincoln’s Inn
Library. The Translator intended to have noticed such parts of the
<span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span>, as coincided with Glanville. But, after having,
with some attention, perused the former Book, he found the similarity
between the two works so very general, and the correspondence so
exact, that the <span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span> might frequently be taken verbal
Translation of Glanville, or, at least, as another Edition of the
same Treatise, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xliii">-xliii-</span> which the writer had made some slight additions
and alterations, and had capriciously amused himself in contriving an
arrangement totally different, though far less happy and systematical.
The Translator has, therefore, generally contented himself with
noticing those deviations between the two works, which were more
immediately relevant to his subjects. Nor has he always stopped
here, but has availed himself of the <span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span>, whenever it
was less ambiguous, or more decided than Glanville, which from the
very circumstance of its being a <i>posterior</i> publication, it
sometimes naturally will happen to be. In addition to the Regiam
Majestatem, reference has been occasionally made to the Grand Custumary
of Normandy, Bracton, Fleta, Britton, Coke, Hale, &amp;c. &amp;c. Some of
these references serve to corroborate—some to illustrate the Text:
some tend to shew that a Law was not peculiar to this Country, and
some that a similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xliv">-xliv-</span> Rule has been adopted even in Modern Times by a
neighboring State. In consulting the Laws of that state, and noticing
those instances of strong or faint resemblance between them and the
Code of Henry the Second, the Translator acted in deference to the
suggestions of a Gentleman, who, though possessed of the most profound
legal knowledge, is yet more entitled to our admiration for his
singular liberality of sentiment, and urbanity of manners. If the more
enlightened mind derive no benefit from the plan which has been adopted
in the notes, and anticipate the Result; yet, it is hoped, the Student
may receive some advantage from it. But, if the Translator has been
too diffuse in some instances, he has, on other occasions, contented
himself with a bare reference. He has been averse to swell the <a href="#FOOTNOTES">Notes</a>,
where a bare citation would serve to direct the Student, if disposed to
extend his inquiries. In addition to the Translator’s own <a href="#FOOTNOTES">Notes</a>, the
Reader is furnished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlv">-xlv-</span> with a few annotations extracted from a copy of
Glanville, formerly belonging to Mr. Justice Aland, and now deposited
in the collection of the Royal Institution. Yet, should it be observed,
it is not perfectly clear whether these annotations were made by that
learned Judge, or by the Reverend Mr. Elstob, a gentleman deeply versed
in Anglo-Saxon Literature. By way of distinction, these Annotations are
particularised by (Al. MS.)</p>

<p>In order to render the work as complete as the limited ability of the
Translator would allow, he has subjoined the more important, and only
the more important various Readings, as furnished by the Bodleian, the
Cottonian, the Harleian and Dr. Milles’s MSS. The MS. of Glanville
deposited in Lincoln’s Inn Library has not been consulted.</p>

<p>The Translator concludes these cursory observations with a brief
summary of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlvi">-xlvi-</span> contents of Glanville, availing himself, in some
measure, of that contained in Mr. Reeves’s History.</p>

<p>Our Author <i>in general</i> confines himself to such matters only as
were the objects of jurisdiction in the <i><span lang="la">Curia Regis</span></i>, and divides
his work into fourteen Books. The two <a href="#Book_I">first</a> of which treat of the Writ
of Right, when originally commenced in the <i><span lang="la">Curia Regis</span></i>, and
of all its stages, the Summons—Essoins—Appearance—Pleadings—Duel or
Grand Assise—Judgment and Execution. The <a href="#Book_III">third</a> speaks of vouching to
Warranty, which with the two former Books, comprises a lucid account of
the proceedings in a Writ of Right for the recovery of Land. The <a href="#Book_IV">fourth
Book</a> is employed upon rights of Advowson, the <a href="#Book_V">fifth</a> upon Villenage,
and the <a href="#Book_VI">sixth</a> upon Dower. The <a href="#Book_VII">seventh</a> treats upon Alienation,
Descents, Succession, Wardship, and Testaments. The <a href="#Book_VIII">eighth</a> is upon
final Concords,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlvii">-xlvii-</span> and Records in general. The <a href="#Book_IX">ninth</a> is upon Homage,
Relief, Fealty, Services, and Purprestures. The <a href="#Book_X">tenth</a> treats of Debts
and matters of Contract; and the <a href="#Book_XI">eleventh</a> upon Attornies. Having thus
disposed of Actions commenced originally in the <i><span lang="la">Curia Regis</span></i>, our
author, in his <a href="#Book_XII">twelfth Book</a>, speaks of Writs of Right, when brought in
the Lord’s Court, and the manner of removing them from thence to the
County Court and <i><span lang="la">Curia Regis</span></i>, which leads him to mention some
other Writs determinable before the Sheriff. In his <a href="#Book_XIII">thirteenth Book</a>, he
treats of Assises, and Disseisins. The <a href="#Book_XIV">last Book</a> is wholly taken up in
discussing the doctrine of Pleas of the Crown.</p>

<p>It was intended to have added the names of all those Gentlemen, who
subscribed for the work. But the list having been consumed in the fire
which destroyed Mr. Reed’s Premises, and many of the names having been
thereby lost, it is become impossible.</p>

<p><span class="xlg"><b>T</b></span><span class="smcap">he</span> Regal Power should not merely be decorated with Arms to restrain
Rebels and Nations making head against it and its realm, but ought
likewise to be adorned with Laws for the peaceful governing of
its Subjects and its People.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> With such felicity may our Most
Illustrious King conduct himself, in the periods both of Peace and of
War, by the force of his right hand, crushing the insolence of the
violent and intractable, and, with the sceptre of Equity, moderating
his Justice towards the humble and obedient, that as he may be always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlix">-xlix-</span>
victorious in subduing his Enemies, so may he on all occasions shew
himself impartially just in the government of his Subjects. But how
gracefully—how vigorously—how skilfully, in counteracting the malice
of his Foes, our Most Excellent King has, in the season of hostility,
conducted his Arms, is manifest to all: since his fame has now spread
over the whole World, and his splendid actions reached even the
confines of the Globe. How justly—how discreetly—and how mercifully—he,
who loves Peace and is the Author of it, has conducted himself towards
his subjects in the time of Peace, is evident, since the Court of his
Highness is regulated with so strict a regard to Equity, that none of
the Judges have so hardened a front, or so rash a presumption, as to
dare to deviate, however slightly, from the path of Justice, or to
utter a sentence, in any measure contrary to the truth. For there,
indeed, the power of his adversary oppresses not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_l">-l-</span> the poor Man, nor
does either the favor or credit of another’s Friends, drive any person
from the seat of Judgment. Since each decision is governed by the Laws
of the Realm, and by those Customs which, founded on reason in their
introduction, have for a long time prevailed; and, what is still more
laudable, our King disdains not to avail himself of the advice of such
men (although his subjects) whom, in gravity of manners, in skill in
the Law and Customs of the Realm, in the superiority of their wisdom
and Eloquence, he knows to surpass others, and whom he has found by
experience most prompt, as far as consistent with reason, in the
administration of Justice, by determining Causes and ending suits,
acting now with more severity, and now with more lenity, as they see
most expedient.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> For the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_li">-li-</span> English Laws, although not written, may as
it should seem, and that without any absurdity, be termed Laws, (since
this itself is a Law—that which pleases the Prince has the force of
Law<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>) I mean, those Laws which it is evident were promulgated by the
advice of the Nobles and the authority of the Prince, concerning doubts
to be settled in their Assembly. For, if from the mere want of writing
only, they should not be considered as Laws, then, unquestionably,
writing would seem to confer more authority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lii">-lii-</span> upon Laws themselves,
than either the Equity of the persons constituting, or the reason
of those framing, them. But, to reduce in every instance the Laws
and Constitutions of the Realm into writing, would be, in our times,
absolutely impossible, as well on account of the ignorance of writers,
as of the confused multiplicity of the Laws. But, there are some,
which, as they more generally occur in Court, and are more frequently
used, it appears to me not presumptuous to put into writing, but rather
very useful to most persons, and highly necessary to assist the memory.
A certain portion of those I therefore intend to reduce into writing,
purposely making use of a vulgar style, and of words occurring in
Court, in order to instruct those who are less accustomed to this kind
of vulgarity. In proof of which, I have distinguished the present work
by Books and Chapters.</p>

default. But although on any of the days appointed for his appearance,
the Tenant should answer in Court, if he lawfully depart, he may recur

some reasonable impediment in the way, by which he is prevented being

neither to lose nor gain, and that, therefore, he had appointed a
certain other person to essoin him; and that the Essoiner himself had
met with such an impediment, which had prevented his appearance on that
day:—and this he is prepared to prove according to the practice of
the Court. By these means, such Essoiner shall be received, and a day
shall be granted to the Tenant, through the medium of such Essoiner,
upon his undertaking to produce his Warrantor on such a given day, when
the Tenant ought to guarantee his principal Essoiner, and to prove his
Essoin in the usual manner. In the same manner, the first Essoiner is

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> service of the King is also another reasonable cause of Essoin,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
and when this Essoin is proved in Court and allowed, the Suit shall
stand over <i><span lang="la">sine die</span></i>, until it appear that the party has returned
from the King’s service. Hence those who are continually in the King’s
service, as his Servants,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> shall not avail themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">-21-</span> of this
Essoin; but, with respect to their persons, the ordinary course of the
Court, and the order of the Law, shall be observed. We must, however,
make a distinction, with respect to the foregoing Essoin. The party
desirous of availing himself of the Essoin <i><span lang="la">per servitium Regis</span></i>,
will either have been summoned by his adversary previously to entering
into such service, or he will have entered into such service in the
first instance, and have afterwards been summoned.</p>

<p>If he were in the first instance in the King’s service, and in the
mean time be summoned to answer the suit, the Rule we have above laid
down must unquestionably prevail. On the other hand, if a party be
impleaded in the first instance, and he afterwards cast the Essoin
<i><span lang="la">per servitium Regis</span></i>, it is material to ascertain, whether he act
by a mandate of the King, or a general or special precept, and be from
necessity in such service, or otherwise. If he were called by a precept
of the King into his service, then, indeed, the same Law prevails, as
in the former instance. But if, on the other hand, voluntarily and
without any such precept, he has recently entered into the King’s
service, it must be distinguished, whether he has gone beyond sea in
that service, or remains within the Realm. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">-22-</span> he has gone beyond Sea,
a respite<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> of forty days, at least, shall be allowed him, but, if
he should not return within that period, the accustomed course of the
Court, and the order of Law shall be observed. At whatever period he
appears in Court, and whether personally, or by his Attorney, he must
immediately produce the King’s Writ, to warrant his preceding Essoins.
But if, on the other hand, the Defendant be within the Realm, and in
the service of the King, in that Case it must be regulated by the
will and pleasure of the King’s Justices, whether a less or a greater
period<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> be allowed him to appear and answer, according as it may
best suit the King, and may be consistent with the course of Justice.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3><a id="BOOK1_CHAP_XXVIII"></a>CHAP. XXVIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> may also happen, that a party is essoined in Court, on account of
some indisposition by which he is confined in the same Town where the
Court is sitting, having arrived there to prosecute his plea. In this
case, let the Court direct, that he appear on the morrow;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">-23-</span> and thus
let him be awaited during three successive days—and for this cause,
he shall have a delay of three successive days. If, on the third day,
he then so essoin himself, then four Knights should be directed by
the Court to attend him for the purpose of ascertaining, whether he
is in such a state as to be able to make his appearance in Court, or
not; and, should they be of opinion that he is able, then, they should
command him, to attend in Court, and do that which he ought. But, if
they should think him unable, and should testify this to the Court,
then shall a reasonable time, a delay of fifteen days at the least, be
allowed him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is also another Essoin, which is sometimes presented in
Court—I allude to that, <i><span lang="la">de esse in peregrinatione</span></i>. But here
a distinction must be made, whether the party who would thus essoin
himself was impleaded before he undertook his Voyage, or not. Because,
in the former case, the course of the Court and the order of Justice
shall be observed. But, if he was not summoned previously to his
beginning his Travels, then again it must be distinguished whether he
went to Jerusalem, or to another place. If to the former place, then a
year and a day, at least, is generally allowed him; but with respect
to other Travels, the time allowed must be regulated by the Will and
pleasure of the King, or his Justices, who, keeping in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">-24-</span> view the length

proper.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. XXX.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Writ directed to the Sheriff, for the purpose of summoning the
party, there is the following clause inserted, “and have there the
summoners and this Writ.”</p>

<p>When, therefore, the Demandant offers himself in Court on the appointed
day, the first inquiry is, whether the Sheriff has the Summoners, and
the Writ there present or not; if he have, and the Summons be proved,
the Suit must be proceeded in, in the manner we have mentioned. But, if
the Sheriff should neither be present on that day, nor appear within
the fourth day, to which time the Tenant must be awaited, then let the
Sheriff be again commanded by the King’s Writ, to summon the Tenant,
concerning the principal cause, by a Writ of second Summons, and that
he himself appear to shew why he neglected to make the Summons, as
enjoined him by the first Writ. The Writ of second Summons contains
that which first issued, with the addition of the following clause:
“<i>and be you yourself then there present to shew wherefore you did
not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">-25-</span> summon him, as it was commanded you by my other Writ, and have
there this Writ, and that other Writ</i>.” At the day appointed, the
Sheriff appearing, either says that he executed the King’s precept, or
confesses that he has not done it.</p>

<p>Should he acknowledge the latter, then he shall be amerced to the King.
But, in this case, the Demandant shall lose his first day, and the
Tenant must be again summoned. But should the Sheriff allege that he
had injoined lawful Summoners to execute the first Summons—and they,
being present, acknowledge the fact, then not only the Sheriff, but the
Summoners shall be amerced,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> if they have not executed such Summons
as it was their duty to do; and thus again the first day will become
useless to the Demandant.</p>

<p>But if those whom the Sheriff nominated as Summoners, being present,
should assert that the Sheriff did not injoin them to summon the
Tenant, we must then distinguish, whether the Sheriff delivered his
order to them in the County Court, as he always ought to do, (in order
that, if the complaint be presented some time before a County Court,
the party may be attached until the County Court, and then there may
be a full Summons,) or in any other manner. If the Sheriff gave his
orders to them in the County Court, and this be properly proved, the
Summoners shall be amerced, because they cannot contradict a fact,
which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">-26-</span> has been transacted in a County Court.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> But if the Sheriff,
being out of the County Court, and less publicly than he ought, injoin
them to summon the Tenant, and they deny that he did so injoin them,
the Sheriff shall be amerced for not having executed the King’s Writ
in the manner that he ought. For public Acts of this nature, such as,
the injoining Summoners—the taking of Pledges for the prosecuting of
Actions—and for Appearances,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> ought to be publicly transacted,
lest concerning these steps, which are merely preparatory to a final
determination, a difficulty should arise, in itself the occasion of
procrastinating the decision. But if, on the first day, the Summoners
should not appear and assert that they had in a legal way executed
the first Summons, but should send their Essoiners on the first day,
who essoin them, and add, that they had properly executed the first
Summons, then the Demandant shall not lose his first day, and they
shall be amerced, because they have not appeared at the first day to
prove that they had executed the Summons as was injoined them, unless
they can excuse their default on that day, by the King’s Warrant. We
must, however, not forget, that either the one or the other of the
Summoners is permitted legally to excuse himself on the first day, and
in that case the Demandant shall not lose the day in question.</p>

<hr class="short">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">-27-</span></p>
<h3>CHAP. XXXI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have spoken concerning the absence of the Tenant, when he is merely
summoned, and no Pledges are given. But, if the suit be of a nature
to make it requisite, that the Tenant should find Pledges for his
appearance, and the Justices or the County Court have recorded them,
(which happens in the civil matter of a breach of a Final Concord made
in the King’s Court before the King or his Justices, and in Novel
Desseisins) then, if the Tenant neither appear at the first day, nor
essoin himself, the Pledges are adjudged to be amerced to the King; and
the Pledges shall be increased as to the principal Cause; and thus,
should the Tenant absent himself on all the three days, the Suit must
be proceeded in; and if at the third Summons he should not appear,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
let his Tenement be taken into the King’s Hands, and retained in
the manner before expressed; the Pledges being amerced, who are to
be summoned to be present in Court on a certain day, to hear their
Judgment. Should, however, the Plea be of a criminal nature, as, for
example, concerning a breach of the King’s Peace, then, the proceedings
must be according to the course of the Law, as in the above case, with
this only difference, that as the party is accused,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> if he fail to
appear at the third Summons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">-28-</span> his body shall be taken, and his Pledges
shall be amerced.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. XXXII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> discussed those points which more frequently arise, in
consequence of the absence of the Tenant, it remains to speak,
concerning the Demandant’s not appearing. If the Demandant indeed
appear not on the first day, he may avail himself of the same
reasonable Essoins as the Tenant, and that by the same means.</p>

<p>If, however, he neither appear nor essoin himself, then, the Court
should award, that the Tenant, if present, either personally, or by
another, as he ought to be, should be unconditionally dismissed. Yet
this is not to preclude the Demandant from recovering, under certain
restrictions, the same property, if he feel inclined to institute
another suit concerning it.</p>

<p>And, if the Demandant be again inclined to implead the same Tenant, it
may be questioned, what the Law is in that case, and how his default
should be punished? As to this, opinions differ. For some say, he shall
lose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">-29-</span> nothing but his Cost<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and his Expenses, and his first Writ,
but not his cause of Action; but merely be obliged again to begin his
suit. Others say, that he shall forfeit his Action against the Tenant
totally, and irrevocably, and, on account of the contempt he has been
guilty of towards the Court, that he shall likewise be amerced to the
King. Others again are of opinion, that he must be amerced to the King,
and that it afterwards depends upon the King’s pleasure, whether he
will be admitted again to institute that Action, or reinstated either
unconditionally, or subject to certain restrictions. Thus far it will
suffice to have treated, where the Action is prosecuted without any
Pledges being given. But, if the Demandant find Pledges for prosecuting
his Suit and fail to appear, either personally or by another, on the
day appointed, then the Tenant shall be unconditionally dismissed. And
the Demandant shall lose his Writ, according to the opinion of some,
and the whole of his Cost; and his Pledges shall be amerced, as before
stated.</p>

<p>But others think, that he shall forfeit his Action,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">-30-</span> and his Pledges,
&amp;c. But this is the consequence when the suit belongs to the Demandant
only, as it generally does in civil cases. When, however, the Suit does
not belong to him only, but the King has an interest in it, as in a
criminal Plea, concerning a breach of the King’s peace, then, as the
Demandant cannot lose the suit, unless as to himself, but is bound to
prosecute it, his Body shall afterwards be imprisoned and kept safely,
until he chuses to prosecute his Appeal,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and, in addition, his
Pledges shall be amerced.</p>

Land,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> both parties being again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">-33-</span> present in Court, the Demandant
should set forth his demand<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and claim in this manner: “I demand
against this <i>H.</i> half a Knight’s Fee or two ploughlands, in such
a Vill, as my Right and Inheritance, of which my Father, or my Grand
Father, was seised in his Demesne as of Fee in the time of King Henry
the First, or after the first Coronation of our Lord the King, and from
whence he took the profits to the Value of five shillings at least, as
in Corn,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Hay, and other produce; and this I am ready to prove by my
Freeman <i>I.</i> and, if any accident happen to him, by such a one,
or by a third” (and the Demandant may thus name, as many as he chuses,
but one of them only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">-34-</span> shall wage the Duel,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>) “who saw this or heard
it:”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> or the Demandant may use other words thus—“and this I am
ready to prove by my Freeman <i>I.</i> to whom his Father, when on his
death-bed, injoined by the Faith which a Son owes to his Father, that
if he ever heard a claim concerning that Land, he should prove this as
that which his Father saw and heard.”<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">-35-</span></p>

<p>The demand and claim of the Demandant being thus made, it shall be
at the election of the Tenant, either to defend himself against the
Demandant by the Duel,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> or to put himself upon the King’s Grand
Assise, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">-36-</span> require a Recognition to ascertain, which of the two have
the greater Right to the Land in dispute.</p>

<p>If he elect the former mode of proceeding, he must deny the right of
the Demandant, word for word as the Demandant has set it forth, and
this, either in person, or by some other fit man. But here we should
observe, that after the Tenant has once waged the Duel he must abide
by his choice, and cannot afterwards put himself upon the Assise.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
In this stage of the suit, the Tenant may again avail himself of three
reasonable Essoins in succession, with respect to his own person and of
the same number with regard to the person of his Champion.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> All the
Essoins which can with propriety be resorted to having expired, it is
requisite, before the Duel can take place, that the Demandant should
appear in Court, accompanied by his Champion armed for the contest. Nor
will it suffice, if he then produce any other Champion than one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">-37-</span>
those, upon whom he put the proof of his claim: neither, indeed, can
any other contend for him, after the Duel has been once waged.</p>

<p>But if he who has waged the Duel should, in the interval pending the
Suit, happen to die, a distinction is to be made. If he died a natural
death, and this is declared by the Vicinage, (as it ought always to be,
if there exist any doubt concerning the fact,) the Demandant may in
the first place recur to one of those upon whom he placed his proof,
or to another proper person, even if he have not named any other,
provided that such other be an unobjectionable Witness—and thus the
Plea may begin again. If, however, his death was occasioned by his own
fault, his Principal shall lose the cause. It may be asked, whether
the Champion of the Demandant can substitute another in Court, to make
that proof which he took upon himself? According, indeed, to the Law,
and ancient custom of the Realm,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> he cannot appoint any other,
unless it be his legitimate Son;<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and here it may be observed, that
the Champion of the Demandant should be such a person as is a proper
Witness of the fact. Nor is it lawful for the Demandant to prosecute
his appeal in his own person, because it is not permitted unless by the
intervention of a proper Witness, who has both heard and seen the fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">-38-</span></p>

<p>But the Tenant may defend himself, either in his own proper person,
if he chuse so to do, or by any other unobjectionable Witness, if
he prefer that course. But, if he has produced a Champion, and such
Champion should die in the interval, it may be asked, what the Law is,
whether the Tenant may defend himself by another Champion, or whether
he ought to lose his suit, or his seisin only? We must here have
recourse to our former distinction. It should also be remarked, that
the Champion of the Tenant cannot substitute another in Court for the
purpose of undertaking the defence, unless it be his own lawful<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Son.</p>

<p>But, it frequently happens, that a hired Champion is produced in
court, who, on account of a reward, has undertaken the proof. If the
adverse party should except to the person of such a Champion, alleging
him to be an improper witness, because he had accepted a reward to
undertake the proof, and should add, that he was prepared to prove
this accusation against the Champion, (if the latter chose to deny it)
either by himself or by another, who was present when the Champion had
taken the reward, the party shall be heard upon this charge, and the
principal Duel shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">-39-</span> be deferred. If, upon this charge, the Champion
of the Demandant should be convicted and conquered in the Duel, then,
his Principal shall lose the suit, and the Champion himself, as
conquered, shall lose his law, namely, he shall from thenceforth never
be admitted in Court, as a Witness, for the purpose of making proof by
Duel, for any other person;<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> but, with respect to himself, he may
be admitted, either in defending his own body, or in prosecuting any
atrocious personal injury, as being a violation of the King’s Peace. He
may also defend by Duel his right to his own Fee and Inheritance.</p>

<p>The Duel being finished, a fine of sixty shillings<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> shall be imposed
upon the party conquered, in the name of Recreantise,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and besides
which he shall lose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">-40-</span> his Law; and, if the Champion of the Tenant should
be conquered, his Principal shall lose the Land in question, with all
the fruits and produce found upon it at the time of Seisin of the Fee,
and never again shall be heard in Court concerning the same Land.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
For those matters, which have been once determined in the King’s Court
by Duel, remain for ever after unalterable. Upon the determination of
the suit, let the Sheriff be commanded by the following Writ, to give
possession of the Land to the successful party.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. IV.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> King to the Sheriff, Health. I command you that, without delay,
you give possession to <i>M.</i> of one Hyde of Land, in such a Vill,
concerning which there was a suit between him and <i>R.</i> in my
Court; because such Hyde of Land is adjudged to him in my Court, by the
Duel. Witness, &amp;c.”</p>

<hr class="short">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">-41-</span></p>


<h3>CHAP. V.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the course of proceeding, when the Demandant has been
successful in the Duel. But if he has been conquered, in the person of
his Champion, then the Tenant shall be freed from his claim, without
any possibility of being again disturbed by him. Thus far concerning
the Duel,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> where the Tenant should chuse or elect that mode of
defending himself, against his Adversary.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. VI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, if the Tenant should prefer putting himself upon the King’s Grand
Assise, the Demandant must either adopt the same course, or decline it.
If the Demandant has once conceded in Court that he would put himself
upon the Assise, and has so expressed himself before the Justices of
the Common Pleas,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> he cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">-42-</span> afterwards retract, but ought either
to stand or fall by the Assise.</p>

<p>If he object to put himself upon the Grand Assise, he ought in such
case to shew some cause, why the Assise should not proceed between
them—such as, that they were of the same blood, and sprung from the
same kindred stock from whence the Inheritance itself descended; and
if the Demandant take this objection, the Tenant will either admit
its validity, or deny it. If he admit it in Court, the Assise itself
shall thereby cease, so that the matter shall be verbally pleaded and
determined in Court; because it is then a question in Law, which of
the parties is the nearer to the original stock, and as such, the Heir
most justly entitled to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">-43-</span> inheritance; and, in this manner, the
nearer Heir shall prove his title, unless his adversary can allege
in Court any reason, why such Heir has lost his right, either for a
time or perpetually, or that any Ancestor of his had so done; as, for
Example, that he has given or sold or exchanged the Land in question,
or, by any other mode which the Law permits, has alienated it; or if
the Heir, or any of his Ancestors, have committed Felony,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and
forfeited their rights entirely, concerning which we shall treat more
fully hereafter. Should the suit on any of these grounds be delayed,
the matter may incidentally, through the Effect of Pleading having
such a tendency, be regularly brought to the Duel. But if he, who has
put himself upon the Assise, deny all Relationship between him and
the Demandant, or, at least, insist, that they were not sprung from
the same stock, from which the Inheritance descended, then, recourse
must be had to the<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> common Kindred of both parties, who for this
purpose are to be called into Court, in order that the Relationship
of the parties to the suit may be investigated on their testimony. If
the Relations unanimously affirm, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">-44-</span> litigating parties have
descended from the same stock, from whence the Inheritance moved, their
assertion is conclusive, unless one of the parties strongly persist in
asserting the contrary; and, in such case, recourse shall be had to the
Vicinage, whose testimony upon this subject, if it coincide with that
of the Relations, must be unreservedly acquiesced in. The same course
must be pursued, if the Relations differ in their Testimony; for then
the parties must abide by the Verdict of the Vicinage. The Inquisition
having been made, if the Parties be unquestionably found and proved to
have sprung from the same stock, from which the Inheritance descended,
the Assise shall cease, and the suit must verbally proceed, as I have
before mentioned. But, if the contrary should appear to the Court and
the King’s Justices, then, the Demandant who took the objection, that
both parties were sprung from the same stock, in order maliciously to
prevent the Assise, shall lose his suit. If nothing intervene to impede
the progress of the Assise, then the question shall be as finally
terminated by that mode of decision as by the Duel.</p>

<h3><a id="BOOK2_CHAP_VII"></a>CHAP. VII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Grand<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Assise is a certain royal benefit bestowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">-45-</span> upon the
people, and emanating from the clemency of the prince, with the advice
of his nobles. So effectually does this proceeding preserve the lives
and civil condition of Men,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> that every one may now possess his
right in safety, at the same time that he avoids the doubtful event
of the Duel. Nor is this all: the severe punishment of an unexpected
and premature Death is evaded, or, at least the opprobrium of a
lasting infamy, of that dreadful and ignominious word<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">-46-</span> that so
disgracefully resounds from the mouth of the conquered Champion.</p>

<p>This legal Institution flows from the most profound Equity. For
that Justice, which, after many and long delays, is scarcely, if
ever, elicited by the Duel, is more advantageously and expeditiously
attained, through the benefit of this Institution. This Assise, indeed,
allows not so many Essoins as the Duel, as will be seen in the sequel.
And by this course of proceeding, both the labor of Men, and the
expences of the poor are saved. Besides, by so much as the testimony
of many credible witnesses, in judicial proceedings, preponderates
over that of one only, by so much greater Equity is this Institution
regulated than that of the Duel. For since the Duel proceeds upon
the testimony of one Juror, this constitution requires the oaths of
twelve lawful men, at least. These are the proceedings which lead to
the Assise. The party who puts himself upon the Assise should, from
the first, and in order to prevent his Adversary from subsequently
impleading him, sue out a Writ for keeping the peace, the suit being
already pending between the parties concerning the Tenement, and the
Tenant having put himself upon the Assise.</p>

<i>M.</i> the Tenant hath put himself upon my Assise, and prays a

of the four Knights is as follows——</p>

<h3>CHAP. XI.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> King to the Sheriff, Health.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Summon, by good summoners, four
lawful Knights of the Vicinage of Stoke, that they be at the Pentecost

greater right in one Hyde of Land in Stoke, which <i>M.</i> claims
against <i>R.</i> by my Writ, and of which <i>R.</i> the Tenant, hath
put himself upon my Assise and prays a Recognition to be made, which
of them have the greater right in that Land; and, cause their names to
be imbreviated. And summon, by good Summoners, <i>R.</i> who holds the
Land, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">-49-</span> he be then there to hear the election, and have there the
Summoners, &amp;c.”</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. XII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> such day the Tenant may essoin himself, and again have recourse to
three reasonable Essoins.</p>

<p>And this, indeed, appears but right; since, as we have explained in a
former part of this Treatise, as often as any one appears in Court, and
there performs that which the Law requires of him, he may again recur
to his Essoins.</p>

<p>But, then, it would happen, or, at least it might so, that as many,
if not a greater number, of Essoins, may intervene in the remedy of
the Grand Assise, as of the Duel, which is by no means compatible
with what we have already laid down. Let us, then, suppose, that the
Tenant has cast three successive Essoins against the election of the
twelve, by the four Knights. After these three Essoins, and upon the
Tenant appearing in Court, one or more of the four Knights may on the
same day cast an Essoin; and, if this be conceded, the Tenant might
again, after the Essoins of the four Knights were expired, essoin
himself afresh, and thus the Assise could scarcely, if ever, be brought
to a conclusion. We should, therefore, observe, that a certain just
Constitution<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> has been passed, under which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">-50-</span> Court is authorised
to expedite the suit, upon the four Knights appearing in Court on the
day appointed them, and being prepared to proceed to the election of
the twelve Knights. Upon this occasion, whether the Tenant appear or
absent himself, the four Knights shall proceed upon their oaths to
elect the twelve. But, if the Tenant himself be present in Court, he
may possibly have a just cause of Exception against one or more of the
Twelve, and concerning this he should be heard in Court. It is usual,
indeed, for the purpose of satisfying the absent party, not to confine
the number to be elected to twelve, but to comprise as many more as may
incontrovertibly satisfy such absent party, when he return to Court.
For Jurors may be excepted against by the same means by which Witnesses
in the Court Christian are justly rejected.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> It should also be
observed, that if the party, who has put himself upon the grand Assise,
appear, although some of the four Knights are absent, the twelve may
be elected by one of the four taking to himself two or three other
Knights from the same County, if such happen to be in Court, though
not summoned for the purpose, provided such course of proceeding meet
with the approbation of the Court, and be mutually consented to by the
litigating parties. But, for greater caution, and to avoid all possible
cavil, it is usual to summon six or more Knights to Court, for the
purpose of making the election.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">-51-</span></p>

<p>Indeed, if the object be to expedite the proceedings, it will more
avail to follow the direction of the Court, than to observe the
accustomed course of the Law. It is, therefore, committed to the
discretion, and Judgment of the King or his Justices, so to temper the
proceeding, as to render it more beneficial and equitable.</p>

the Right of Advowson to any Church. Nor is the party confined to this
remedy, as against a stranger merely, but he may avail himself of it
against his Lord for the purpose of ascertaining, whether the Lord has
greater Right to retain the object in question in his Demesne, or the
Tenant to hold it of him. It is easy to form a Writ, adapted to the

having, when in Court, put himself upon the Grand Assise, be precluded
from alleging any reason, why it should be deferred. It is different
with respect to the absence of the Demandant. If he should essoin

equally holds.</p>

<p>If the Land in question be adjudged to the Demandant, he shall be
remitted to the Sheriff of the County, where the Land is situated, in
order to recover his possession.</p>

<p>And, for this purpose, he shall have the following Writ——</p>

<h3>CHAP. XX.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> King to the Sheriff, Health. I command you that, without delay,
you deliver possession to <i>N.</i> of one Hyde of Land, in such a
Vill, which he claims against <i>R.</i> of which the said <i>R.</i> put
himself upon my Assise, because the said <i>R.</i><a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> has recovered

more, provided the number did not exceed twelve, who, as Witnesses of

suppose that they were of such an age as to be qualified to make proof
by the Duel, and should make use of all such words in Court, on account
of which the Duel is generally awarded. After all this, it may be
doubted, whether any of them shall be heard upon the subject.</p>

<h3>CHAP. I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the presence of the Tenant only happens to be requisite, and in
itself precludes the necessity of any other person appearing to answer,
the order of Pleading which is observed in Court is such as we have
described.</p>

<p>But the presence of another party becomes no less necessary than that
of the Tenant, if the latter declare in Court, that the subject in
dispute is not his own, but that he merely holds it, as a Loan,<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
or a Hireing, or a Pledge, or as committed to his Custody, or in some
other mode entrusted to him by another; or if he should allege, that
the property were his own, but that he had a Warrantor<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> from whom
he had received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">-60-</span> it, either as a Gift, or Sale, or in Exchange, or,
generally, found his Title to the thing upon any other cause of this
nature.</p>

<p>If the Tenant should declare in Court, that the property is not his
own, but belongs to another, then, such other person must be summoned
by another Writ, but yet of a similar nature—and thus the plea shall be
commenced anew against him. And when such other person at last appears
in Court, he in the same manner will declare, either that the property
belongs to him, or not. If the latter, then, the party who had first
asserted in Court, that the property did belong to him, shall thereby
lose the Land irretrievably, and he shall be summoned to appear in
Court, and hear his Judgment; and thus, whether he appear or absent
himself, his Adversary shall recover possession. When the Tenant call
a person into Court to warrant the Land, then, a reasonable day shall
be given him in Court to produce such person there; and thus he may
anew recur to three Essoins, with respect to his own person, and to the
same number, with regard to the person of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">-61-</span> his Warrantor. The person
cited to warrant having at last appeared in Court, he will either enter
into the warranty of the subject in dispute, or decline it. If he adopt
the former course, he then becomes a Principal Party in the suit, so
that the remainder of the cause shall be entirely carried on in his
name; but if, previous to this step, he essoin himself, the Tenant
cannot excuse himself by an Essoin, but, if absent, shall be adjudged
in default. If, however, the person called to warrant, being present
in Court, should fail in entering into the warranty, then, the plea
must altogether be continued between him and the party who has called
him—and thus, by means of pleading conducive to such an end, the matter
may come to the decision of the Duel, and that, whether the Tenant can
produce his Charter of Warranty, or not, if he be prepared with an
unobjectionable Witness to make proof, and he is willing to undertake
it. It should be observed, that when it is once ascertained, that the
person cited to warrant ought to take that obligation upon him, the
Tenant shall not afterwards lose the property in dispute, because if
such property should be recovered in Court, the Warrantor shall be
bound to make the Tenant a competent equivalent<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> if he possess
sufficient means so to do.</p>

<hr class="short">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">-62-</span></p>

<h3>CHAP. II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> it sometimes happens, that the person called to Court to warrant is
unwilling to appear there, either for that purpose, or to shew that he
ought not to warrant to the Tenant the property in question. In that
case, upon the petition of the Tenant, and by the order and indulgence
of the Court, the reluctant party shall be compelled to do so, and he
shall be summoned by the following Writ.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. III.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> King to the Sheriff, Health. Summon, by good Summoners, <i>N.</i>
that he be before me, or my Justices, there on a certain day to warrant
to <i>R.</i> one Hyde of Land, in such a Vill, which he claims as his
Gift, or the Gift of <i>M.</i> his Father, if he will warrant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">-63-</span> it to
him, or to shew wherefore he ought not to warrant it to him; and have
the Summoners and this Writ. Witness Ranuph, &amp;c.”</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. IV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the day appointed, the Warrantor can either essoin himself, or not.
If not, then, that indulgence which is allowed to another would be
denied him, not being culpable; which would be no less inconvenient
than unjust.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> If he may essoin himself, let us suppose that he has
properly essoined himself three times successively, it should on the
third day, according to the Law and practice of the Court, be ordered,
that he appear on the fourth day, or send an Attorney. If, on that
day, he neither appear nor send an Attorney, it seems a question what
steps are to be pursued. Because were the Tenement to be taken into
the King’s hands, such a step would seem an injustice committed on the
right of the Tenant, since he has not been adjudged in default.</p>

<p>But if this course be not pursued, then the right of the Demandant,
supposing he possesses any, would be unjustly deferred. And, indeed,
the course mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">-64-</span> shall be adopted, as most consonant to the Law
and Custom of the Realm. Because, if any one should lose his Land, or
merely the possession of it, through the default of his Warrantor, the
latter shall be compelled to make him an equivalent recompense, and
may, therefore, by means of the foregoing Writ, be distrained to appear
in Court, and warrant the Tenement itself, or shew some reason on
account of which, he should be exempt from the obligation of warranty.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. V.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> sometimes happens, that the Tenant, although he has a Warrantor,
does not call him into Court, but takes upon himself entirely to
dispute the Demandant’s claim.</p>

<p>If the Tenant should pursue this course, and should lose the Land in
question by the Duel, he cannot afterwards recover any thing against
the Warrantor.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>But, according to this, a question may be proposed, whether, as any one
can defend himself by the Duel, without the assent and presence of his
Warrantor, he can put himself upon the King’s Grand Assise, without the
assent and presence<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> of the Warrantor? And, indeed, he may defend
himself by the Assise upon a parity of reason as by the Duel.</p>

<hr class="short">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">-65-</span></p>

<h3>CHAP. VI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> it sometimes happens, that the matter is deferred on account of
the absence of the Lords, when, for example, the Demandant claims the
Tenement in question, as belonging to the fee of one Lord, and the
Tenant, as belonging to that of another. In such a case, both the
Lords must be summoned to Court, in order that, in their presence, the
Plea may be heard, and, in the accustomed manner, decided, least any
injustice should seem to be done to them when absent.</p>

<p>But upon the day on which they are summoned to appear in Court, both
or either of them may lawfully cast an Essoin, and this three times in
the usual manner. Should the Lord of the Tenant have recurred to three
Essoins, it should be ordered, that he appear personally in Court, or
send his Attorney.</p>

<p>If after this, he neither appear, nor send his Attorney, let the
Tenant be directed to Answer and take the defence upon himself; and,
if he should prevail, he shall retain the Land to himself, and from
thenceforth shall do service to the King, because his Lord shall lose
his service through his default, until he appear and perform there that
which he ought to do.</p>

<p>In the same manner, may the Lord of the Demandant essoin himself; but,
when he at last appear in Court, it may be asked, whether the Lord of
the Tenant can again essoin himself? He may, indeed, until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">-66-</span> he has once
appeared in Court; because it is, then, incumbent upon him to allege
some reason, why he ought not to wait any longer; and this Rule equally
prevails with respect to the person of either Lord. But if, after
having availed himself of three Essoins, the Lord of the Demandant
should be absent, it may be a question, what the Law is? If, indeed,
he should have first essoined himself, the Essoiners themselves shall
be taken into custody, and the body of the Demandant himself shall be
attached,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> on account of his contempt of Court; and thus he shall
be distrained to appear in Court, that it may be heard what he has to
allege.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. VII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> both the Lords appear in Court, the Lord of the Tenant will
warrant the Land in question, as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">-67-</span> his Fee, or he will deny that
it is so. If he adopt the former course, it remains for him, either
to take the defence upon himself, or entrust it to the Tenant, as he
may feel disposed; and whichever course he pursues, the right of each
of them will be saved, as well that of the Lord as of the Tenant, if
their party should prevail in the contest. But, if the contrary should
be the result, the Lord shall lose his services, and the Tenant his
Land irretrievably. If the Lord of the Tenant, being present in Court,
fail in the Warranty, the matter may be interpleaded between them,
provided that the Tenant declare, that his Lord had unjustly failed in
the Warranty, and, therefore unjustly, because he or his Ancestors had
performed such and such specific services to the Lord or his Ancestors,
as Lords of that fee, adding that of this fact he has those who have
heard and seen it, and, in particular, a proper witness to prove it, or
some other adequate and sufficient testimony ready to be adduced, as
the Court shall direct.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. VIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A similar</span> distinction must be made, in respect of the person of the
Lord of the Demandant. When he appears in Court, he will either claim
the Land in question, as in his fee, or not. And thus if he warrant the
Title of the Demandant, and claim the Land as within his Fee, it is at
his option, either to hold himself to the proof made by the Demandant,
if he be so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">-68-</span> inclined, or to take upon himself to prove his Right
against the other, saving the Right of both of them, namely, as well
his own as that of the Demandant, if their party prevail in the suit.
If, however, it happen to be unsuccessful, both the Demandant and his
Lord shall lose their right. On the other hand, if the Lord decline to
warrant the claim of the Demandant, then, the latter shall be amerced
to the King on account of his false claim.</p>

<h3>CHAP. I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Pleas</span> concerning Ecclesiastical Advowsons<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> are accustomed to be
agitated, as well when the church is vacant, as when it is not vacant.
If, upon a vacancy of a church, he who is seised of the Advowson
should present a Parson<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> to it, and any one should question the
Presentation and claim it, then, it must be distinguished, whether the
dispute be concerning the Advowson itself, in other words, the right
itself of presenting a Parson, or whether it merely relates to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">-70-</span>
last Presentation, that is, the Seisin of the right of presenting a
Parson. If the dispute merely concern the last Presentation, and the
Claimant allege, that he or one of his Ancestors had the last Donation
and Presentation, then, the Plea shall be discussed by the Assise
appointed concerning Ecclesiastical Advowsons; and an Assise shall be
summoned to make Recognition, what Patron in time of peace presented
the Parson who last died to that Church; and concerning this Assise
we shall speak more fully hereafter,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> when we come to treat of
other Recognitions. The party who by this Assise proves in Court the
last Presentation, shall thereby recover Seisin of the Presentation of
the vacant Church, concerning which the dispute is; so that he shall
lawfully present a Parson to the Church, saving the right and claim of
the Demandant with respect to the Right of Advowson.</p>

<p>But, if the right of Advowson be the sole subject of dispute, then
the Demandant should subjoin to his claim, that he, or one of his
Ancestors, had the last Presentation of that Church; or, he should
concede, that his Adversary, or one of his Ancestors, had the last
Presentation; or, he should allege, that some third person had the last
Presentation; or, in fine, that he knows not who had it.</p>

<p>Whichever of these courses he pursues, if his Adversary claim the
last Presentation, as made in his own person, or in that of one of
his Ancestors, the Recognition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">-71-</span> shall in every instance proceed upon
the Right of Presentation, unless in one only of the foregoing cases,
namely, when the Demandant concedes to his Adversary, that he or one
of his Ancestors, enjoyed the last Presentation, for then, without
having recourse to a Recognition, he shall present one Person at least.
The last Presentation being decided by the Assise or by some other
legal mode, and a Parson being instituted into the Church upon the
Presentation of the successful party, then shall the person, who is
inclined to contend for the Right of Advowson, have the following Writ.</p>

complains that he unjustly deforced him; and, unless he do so, summon

Essoins, and that by the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">-72-</span> means, as we have already detailed,
in treating concerning Pleas affecting Land. Supposing, then, that
after having cast three Essoins, he should neither appear nor send an
Attorney on the fourth day, it may be asked what the Law is?</p>

<p>In such a case, the seisin of the Presentation of the Church shall be

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Sheriff is bound to execute this Writ, in the following manner:
he should go to the Church in question, and there in a public manner,

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> the Essoins to which the Defendant can have recourse being
terminated, at the day appointed for the parties in Court, either both,
or neither, or one only, of the parties will appear. If one only, or
both of them, be absent, the matter must be ordered in a manner similar
to that we have formerly explained, in treating of Pleas concerning
Land. But if both parties appear in Court, the Demandant should then
propound his right as against his Adversary, in the following words: “I
demand the Advowson of this Church, as my right, and appertaining to my
Inheritance, and of which Advowson I was seised, or one of my Ancestors
was seised, in the time of King Henry the 1st, the Grandfather of our
Lord King Henry, or after the Coronation of our Lord the King; and
being so seised, I presented a Parson to the same Church when vacant,
at one of the before-mentioned periods; and I so presented him, that
upon my presentation he was instituted Parson into that Church; and
if any one would deny this, I have some credible Men who both saw and
heard the fact, and are ready to prove it as the Court shall award, and
particularly such, and such persons.” The claim of the Demandant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">-74-</span> being
heard, the Tenant may defend himself by the Duel; and the proceedings
will accordingly, from that period, be conducted in the manner we have
formerly explained. Should, however, the Tenant chuse to put himself
upon the Grand Assise, he is perfectly at liberty so to do; and the
Assise must then proceed in the form we have previously detailed.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. VII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, although a Church be not vacant, a dispute may arise concerning
the Advowson of it, if the Parson of the Church, or he who is invested
with that Character, derive his Title from one Patron, at the same time
as another Person, conceiving himself to be the more rightful Patron
of such Church, lay claim to the Advowson. In such case, the following
Writ shall be issued upon his application.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. VIII.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> King to the Sheriff, Health. Summon, by good Summoners, the
Clerk <i>N.</i>, Parson of such a Church, that he be before me, or
my Justices, at Westminster, on such a day, to shew of what Patron
he holds himself in that Church, the Advowson of which the Knight
<i>M.</i> claims to belong to him. Summon also, by good Summoners,
<i>N.</i> who deforced him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">-75-</span> of the Advowson, that he be there to shew
why he deforced him of that Advowson, and have there the Summoners and
this Writ. Witness, &amp;c.”</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. IX.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span>, after the Clerk has been summoned, he neither appear on the
appointed day, nor send any one to excuse his absence, neither on the
first, second, nor third summons, it may be doubted, by what mode he
should be distrained to appear in Court, especially if he possess no
lay Fee, to which recourse can be had for such purpose.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> A similar
doubt may be proposed upon the course to be pursued, should he, after
having thrice essoined himself in Court, neither appear on the fourth
day, nor send an Attorney to answer for him.</p>

<p>Should either of these cases occur, let the Bishop of the place, or
his Official, if there happen to be no Bishop, be enjoined to distrain
the Clerk to appear in Court, or to punish his default, by taking the
Church into his hands, or to distrain the Clerk by some other lawful
means.</p>

<p>When, at last, the Clerk appear in Court, he will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">-76-</span> either acknowledge
the Demandant as Patron, and admit that he was instituted upon his
Presentation, or upon that of one of his Ancestors, or he will allege
some other person to be the Patron.</p>

<p>In the former case, the Plea shall cease in the King’s Court. If the
Patron deny the assertion of the Clerk, alleging himself to have been
instituted upon his Presentation, or that of one of his Ancestors, and
be disposed to contest this point against the Clerk, the Plea shall
be discussed before his Ecclesiastical Judge. But, if the Clerk name
another Patron, such Patron should be summoned to appear in Court,
which Summons he will either obey, or not. In the latter case, if he
neither appear at the first, second, nor third Summons; or if, having
essoined himself in Court the first, second, and third times, he should
neither appear nor send an Attorney on the fourth day, it may be asked,
by what means he shall be distrained, and how his default shall be
punished? The Advowson of the Church in question shall indeed be taken
into the King’s hands, and thus remain for fifteen days; and if, within
that period, the Clerk should not appear, then, the Demandant shall
have the Seisin delivered to him. But what shall be done to the Clerk
himself? Whether shall he from that circumstance, lose his Church?<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>But, if the Party summoned appear in Court, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">-77-</span> will either acknowledge
himself Patron of the Church in question, or disclaim all right to the
Advowson.</p>

<p>Should he pursue the latter course, the Suit shall cease in the King’s
Court, and the cause must be discussed between the Patron and the
Clerk, in the Ecclesiastical Court. But if, whilst the Suit be pending,
the Church itself happen to become vacant, it may be asked, to whom
the intervening Presentation belongs? If, indeed, there be no doubt
moved concerning the last Presentation, but the person against whom
the Right of Advowson be sought, or one of his Ancestors had the last
Presentation, then, he shall present the Parson in the mean time, and
until he lose his Seisin. It is a consequence of the same principle,
that if the Advowson of any Church should be seised into the King’s
hands on account of the default of the Patron, and, during the fifteen
days, it should happen to become vacant, the Patron shall not within
that period lose his Presentation. But, if the party summoned, should
claim the Right of Advowson, and elect to defend it as his own, then,
indeed, the Suit must proceed in the order we have already explained.
If he should prevail, he and his Clerk shall be freed from the Claim of
their Adversary; but, if he fail in the Suit, then, he and his Heirs
shall for ever lose the Advowson.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. X.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> what course shall be pursued with the Clerk, the Parson of the
Church, who has declared in Court,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">-78-</span> that he held the living upon
his<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Presentation? In the King’s Court, indeed, nothing farther is
to be done in the matter, unless as it concerns the Advowson between
the two Patrons.</p>

<p>But the Patron, who has recently recovered the Right of Advowson,
shall proceed against the Clerk in the Ecclesiastical Court before the
Bishop or his Official, under these restrictions—if, at the time of
Presentation, the Person presenting such Clerk was considered to be
the Patron, then, the Church shall continue to be held by the Clerk,
during the remainder of his life. For, upon this subject, a Statute has
been passed in the Reign of the present King, concerning those Clerks
who have obtained Livings upon the Presentation of such Patrons as
have, in time of war, violently intruded themselves into Ecclesiastical
Advowsons; and by such Statute it is provided, that Clerks thus
presented shall not lose their Churches during their lives. Thus is the
question above proposed, resolved. But, after the decease of Clerks
so presented, the Presentations of the Churches shall return to the

<h3>CHAP. XI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> connected with the preceding subject, a question arises. Let us
suppose that a Patron has, in the King’s Court, recovered the Advowson
as against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">-79-</span> another; and that afterwards, in process of time, the Clerk
of the Church should die. In such a case, can the party against whom
the Advowson had been recovered again demand an Assise, concerning
the last Presentation; and, if he should obtain a Writ to summon the
Assise, what step must his Adversary resort to? Let us suppose, that
he himself had never presented an Incumbent to the church in question,
but that his Father, or at least one of his Ancestors, had so done,
and it be objected to him by his Adversary, that he ought not to have
a Recognition, because he had already lost the Advowson by the former
Judgment of the Court, whether, it may be asked, shall the Assise
cease on that account, or not? It appears that it ought<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> to cease,
because, not having the last Presentation, he never had the Seisin of
the Advowson; but, it seems, that he might well found his claim upon
the Seisin of his Father, notwithstanding any thing that may have been
done, concerning the Right itself of Presentation. But if the point of
the last Presentation can be again agitated, then, it should seem, that
the Judgments of the King’s Court are not of perpetual obligation. For
if the Advowson of a Church were once adjudged to any person, it does
not appear consistent with Justice that the Adverse party should by
any means, which can be subsequently resorted to, recover any Seisin
in that Court, especially against him in whose favor the Advowson has
been already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">-80-</span> decided, unless any new circumstance should intervene,
on account of which he ought again to be heard. If therefore, an
Assise should be summoned for that purpose, it should cease from this
circumstance, that although it were conceded that the Claimant, or one
of his Ancestors, had the last Presentation, yet it might be alleged,
that, if he or his Ancestors had any Right, they lost it by the
Judgment of the King’s Court; and, this being proved by the Record of
the Court, the Complainant shall lose his cause, and shall in addition
be amerced to the King.</p>

<h3>CHAP. XII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> should be observed, that it sometimes happens, that one Clerk sues
another in the Ecclesiastical Court, concerning a Church. Should they
derive their Titles through different Patrons, the Ecclesiastical Court
may, upon the petition of either of the Patrons, be prohibited from
proceeding in the Suit, until it be ascertained, in the King’s Court,
to which Patron the Advowson of the Church belongs. For this purpose
the following Writ shall Issue.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> King to such Ecclesiastical Judges, Health. <i>R.</i> hath made

<h3>CHAP. I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> subject leads us in the next place to treat of Pleas concerning
the Conditions of persons. Questions upon this subject arise, when
any one would draw another, from a state of freedom, into that of
Villenage;<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> or when any one, being in the latter state, seeks to
emancipate himself. When any one claims another who is in Villenage
as his Villein-born,<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> he shall have the Writ <i><span lang="la">de nativis</span></i>,
directed to the Sheriff; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">-84-</span> by that Writ he shall, before the
Sheriff of the County, claim the Villein against him, who holds him
in Villenage. And, if his Villenage be not denied before the Sheriff
in the County Court, then the Plea concerning such Villein-born shall
proceed before the Sheriff, as we shall presently explain, between the
person claiming, and the person in possession, of the Villein. But,
if the Villein allege himself to be a freeman, and give security to
the Sheriff to prove the fact, then, the suit shall cease, as far as
applies to the County Court; because the Sheriff ought not any farther
to interfere in it.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> But, if the Sheriff persist in hearing the
suit, then, he whose condition is questioned shall complain to the
Justices, and shall obtain the King’s Writ, in order that, if he should
give security to the Sheriff to prove his freedom, the suit may be
removed before the Justices of the King’s Court, and in the mean time,
the party be unmolested. The Writ is as follows.—</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> King to the Sheriff, Health.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> <i>R.</i> complains to me that
<i>N.</i> draws him to Villenage, although he is a freeman, as he says.
And, therefore, I command you that, if the said <i>R.</i> make you
secure of prosecuting his claim, then, that you put the suit before me,
or my Justices, on such a day; and, in the mean time, you cause that he
be in peace; and summon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">-85-</span> by good Summoners, the aforesaid <i>N.</i>
that he be then there to shew why, he unjustly draws him to Villenage.
And have there, &amp;c.”</p>

<h3>CHAP. III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the same Writ, the party who lays claim to the other, as being
his Villein, shall be summoned; and a day shall be appointed him on
which he may prosecute his claim. But, if on the day appointed, the
person who is claimed as a Villein should neither appear, nor send
a Messenger, nor Essoin, let the same course be pursued, as that
before described in treating of Pleas, where the Pledges are to be
attached. But, if he chuse to essoin himself, he may avail himself
of the same number of Essoins, and on the same occasions as we have
already mentioned. But if the party who claims the other as his
Villein, neither appear on that day, nor send, let the other party,
if present, be dismissed unconditionally, under such form, namely,
that the claimant shall recover so much as by Law he ought to recover,
concerning which principle we have spoken more fully, in the preceding
part of this Treatise. In the mean time, the party who is claimed as a
Villein shall be in Seisin of his freedom.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. IV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Both</span> parties being present in Court, the freedom shall be there proved
in this manner: the party who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">-86-</span> claims his liberty, shall produce a
number of his nearest relations and kindred, springing from the same
stock from which he descended. If their freedom be recognized and
proved in Court, the party who demands<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> his freedom shall be
liberated from the yoke of servitude. But, if the free condition of
those produced be denied,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> or a doubt be entertained respecting it,
recourse shall be had to the Vicinage, whose Verdict shall ascertain
the fact, whether those produced are free, or not: and, according to
its decision, the matter shall be adjudged. But, if the party who
claims the other as his Villein, should bring forward other persons to
prove the contrary, namely, that such persons as the claimant has now
brought forward are his Villeins-born, and that they sprung from the
same common stock with him, whom he claims as a Villein-born, then,
in like manner, should those produced by both sides be recognized as
of common kindred, let it be inquired by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">-87-</span> the Vicinage,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> which of
them are the nearest to him; and, according as the inquiry turns out,
let the Judgment be given. In a similar manner, if those produced by
one party should<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> deny in any respect his relationship, or, if
a question arise concerning it, every doubt of this nature shall be
determined by the Vicinage. The freedom having been sufficiently proved
in Court, then, the party whose liberty has been questioned shall be
absolved from the claim of him who would draw him to Villenage, and
for ever freed from it. If, however, he should fail in his proof, or,
if he should be recovered by his Adversary as his Villein-born, he
shall be irrecoverably adjudged to belong to his Lord, together with
all the Chattels he possesses. The same form and order are observed
in pleading, when a freeman is claimed as a Villein, or when any one,
in a state of Villenage, aspires of his own accord to freedom. For
this purpose, the party whose freedom is impeached shall come to the
King’s Court, and pray, that the suit might be removed into the same,
which being conceded, the suit will then proceed in the form before
stated. It must be remarked concerning this Plea, that the Duel cannot
be resorted to, in order to prove the freedom of any one from his
Birth.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<hr class="short">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">-88-</span></p>
<h3>CHAP. V.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are many modes by which a Man, in a state of Villenage, may
acquire his freedom.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Thus if his Lord, being desirous of
emancipating him, releases him, as well from all his own claims, as
those of the Lord’s Heirs: or, if the Lord give or sell him to another,
for the purpose of liberating him. It must,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">-89-</span> however, be observed,
that no one in a state of Villenage can purchase his freedom with his
own Money; for, in such case, he may, according to the Law and Custom
of the Realm, be again recalled by his Lord to a state of Villenage,
all the Chattels of a Villein-born being understood as so absolutely
in the power of his Lord, as to preclude the former, at least with
his own Money, and as against his Lord, from redeeming himself from
Villenage. But, if a stranger with his own Money purchase the Villein’s
freedom, the Villein may for ever after maintain his freedom against
his Lord, who has sold him. When any one has released a Villein, from
all right which he, or his Heirs, could claim in him, or has sold him
to a stranger, the Villein who has been thus enfranchised may for ever
after defend his freedom, as well against the Lord himself, as his
Heirs; whilst he can prove the fact in Court, either by a Charter, or
by any other lawful means. And the question may even be decided by the
Duel, if any one deny, that the party has been liberated from his state
of Villenage, and, there be a proper Witness, who, having both seen and
heard the very fact of Enfranchisement, is ready to prove his freedom
in Court.</p>

<p>It should here be remarked, that a man may enfranchise his
Villein-born, so far as the consequences affect the persons of himself,
or his Heirs, but not as they apply to others. Because, if a man born
a Villein, but thus rendered free, should be produced in Court, to
make proof against a stranger, or to wage his Law, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">-90-</span> may be justly
precluded, if it be objected against him, and proved in Court, that
he was born in a state of Villenage, although his condition was such
that he had been Knighted subsequently to his being enfranchised.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
If a Villein-born peaceably remain during a year and a day<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> in
any privileged Town<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> so that he be received in their community or
Guild<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> as a Citizen, he shall from such circumstance be freed from
Villenage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">-91-</span></p>
<h3><a id="BOOK5_CHAP_VI"></a>CHAP. VI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Villeins-born</span> are such from their Birth. Thus, if both the parents
are Villeins-born, the Offspring is a Villein-born.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The same may
be said where the Father is free but the Mother a Villein-born. If,
however, the Mother be free, and the Father a Villein-born, the same
rule prevails, as far as the purity of Condition be in question.</p>

<p>If a freeman take to wife a woman born in Villenage, whilst he so
continues bound to the state of Villenage, he shall as a consequence
lose his Law, as if he himself were a Villein-born.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> If there
be any children resulting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">-92-</span> from the connection of a Woman born in
Villenage belonging to one person, and a Man born in that state
belonging to another, the children shall be proportionably divided
between the two Lords.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<h3>CHAP. I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> term Dower is used in two senses. Dower,<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> in the sense in which
it is commonly used, means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">-94-</span> that which any free man at the time of
his being affianced,<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> gives to his Bride at the Church Door.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
For every Man is bound as well by the Ecclesiastical Law, as by the
secular, to endow his Bride, at the time of his being affianced to
her. When a man endows his Bride, he either names the Dower, or not.
In the latter case, the third part of all the Husband’s freehold Land
is understood to be the Wife’s Dower; and the third part of all such
freehold Lands as her Husband held, at the time of affiancing,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and
of which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">-95-</span> was seised in his Demesne, is termed a Woman’s reasonable
Dower. If, however, the Man name the Dower, and mention more than a
third part, such designation shall not avail, as far as it applies
to the quantity. It shall be reduced by admeasurement to the third
part;<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> because a Man may endow a Woman of less, but cannot of more,
than a third part of his Land.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Should</span> it happen, as it sometimes does, that a man endows a Woman,
having but a small freehold at the time of his being affianced, he may
afterwards enlarge her Dower to the third part or less of the Lands, he
may have<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> purchased.</p>

<p>But if upon the Assignment of Dower, no mention was made concerning
purchases, even admitting that at the time of affiance he possessed
but a small Estate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">-96-</span> and that he afterwards much increased it, the
Wife cannot claim as Dower more than a third part of such Land as her
Husband held, at the time of being affianced, and when he endowed her.
The same Rule prevails if a Man, not being possessed of any Land,
should endow his Wife with his Chattels,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and other things, or
even with Money. Should he afterwards make considerable purchases in
Land and Tenements, the Wife cannot claim any part of such property so
acquired by purchase; it being, with respect to the quantity or quality
of the Dower assigned to any Woman, a general principle, that if she is
satisfied to the extent of her endowment at the door of the Church, she
can never afterwards claim as Dower anything beyond it.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<hr class="short">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">-97-</span></p>
<h3>CHAP. III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> should be understood, that a Woman<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> cannot, during the life of
her Husband, make any disposition of her Dower.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> For since the Wife
herself is in a legal sense under the absolute power of her Husband,
it is not singular, if the Dower, as well as the Woman herself and all
other things belonging to her, should be considered to be fully at the
disposal of the Husband. But any one, having a Wife, may either give or
sell her Dower, or, by any other mode he pleases, may alienate it in
his lifetime; so that the Wife shall be bound to conform to his will
in this as in all other respects which are not contrary to the Law of
God. And so far is the Woman bound to obey her Husband, that if her
Husband chuses to sell her Dower, and she refuses her consent, and the
Dower be afterwards sold and bought under these circumstances, the Wife
cannot<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> after the death of her Husband claim her Dower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">-98-</span> as against
the Purchaser, if she confess in Court or is convicted upon the fact
that, although she opposed her Husband, the Dower was sold by him.</p>

<h3>CHAP. IV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> the death of the Husband of a Woman, her Dower, if it has been

<p>In the former case, the woman may, with the consent of the Heir, enter

the Dower be not vacant, either the whole will be so circumstanced, or
some part will be vacant, and some not. If a certain part be vacant,
and a certain part not, she may pursue the course we have described,
and enter into the part which is vacant; and for the residue, she shall
have a Writ of Right, directed to her Warrantor<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> in order to compel
him to do complete Justice concerning the Land, which she claims as

Court concerning the plea itself, and which that court is unable to
decide; (and when any suit is thus transferred to the Court, then both
parties, as well the Tenant as the Demandant, shall be summoned.) But,
when it has been removed upon the Petition of one of the parties, it
will then suffice, if that party be summoned who did not require the
removal: but, if the suit should be transferred to Court by the consent
and prayer of both parties, being present in Court together, then,
neither party ought to be summoned, because the day appointed in Court
is known to both of them. Upon the day appointed in Court, either both
parties will be absent, or only one will be so, or both will appear. We
have already sufficiently treated concerning the absence of both, or of
one only of the parties. If both be present in Court, the Woman shall
set forth her claim against her Adversary in the following words. “I
demand such Land, as appertaining to such Land, which was named to me
in Dower, and of which my Husband endowed me at the door of the Church,
the day he espoused me, as that of which he was invested and seised at

<p><span class="smcap">When</span>, at last, the Heir of the Husband of the Woman, the complainant,
appear in Court, either he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">-104-</span> will affirm the fact, and concede that the
Land in question appertains to the Dower of the Woman, and that she was
endowed of it, and that his Ancestor at the time he endowed her was
seised of it as an appurtenant to the Land which he named in chief, as
her Dower, or, he will deny it. If the Heir admit this in Court, he
shall then be bound to recover the Land against the Tenant, if he be
disposed to dispute the matter, and then deliver it to the woman; and
thus the contest will be changed into one between the Tenant and the
Heir.</p>

<p>If, however, the Heir be unwilling to contest the point, he shall
be bound to give to the Woman a competent equivalent; because, the
Woman herself shall not afterwards sustain any loss. But, if the Heir
himself neither admit nor concede to the Woman that which she alleges
against the Tenant, then, the suit may proceed between the Woman and
the Heir. For a Woman cannot with Effect bring an Action against any
one, without the Warrantor of her Dower.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> If, therefore, the Heir
should absolutely deny the Right of the Woman, alleging in Court, that
she never was endowed by his Ancestor, the matter may be decided by the
Duel, provided the Woman produce in Court those who heard and saw the
Endowment, or any proper Witness who may have heard and seen the fact
of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">-105-</span> being endowed by the Ancestor of the Heir at the Church door,
at the time of the Espousals, and be ready to prove such fact against
him.</p>

<p>Should the Woman prevail against the Heir in the Duel, then the Heir
shall be bound to deliver the Land in question to the Woman,<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> or to

<h3>CHAP. XVII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> suit between the Heir and the Widow, may be infinitely varied. For
the Woman will either claim her Dower, as named, or her reasonable
Dower as not named. The Heir also may admit that her Dower was named,
but that it differs from that she demands; or he may allege, that no
Dower was specified.</p>

<p>If the contest between them be concerning Dower which was named, or
concerning different nominations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">-108-</span> of it, then, the Plea may proceed
in the manner we have above described. But if a reasonable Dower be
demanded, no specific nomination having been made, the Law is perfectly
clear, that the Heir is bound to assign to the Woman as her Dower, a
third part of all the freehold Tenements that his Ancestor held in his
Demesne, on the day of the Espousals, and this unreservedly, in every
thing, as in Lands, and Tenements, and Ecclesiastical Advowsons,<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
so that if there should be but one Church in the whole Inheritance,
and such happen to fall vacant in the life of the woman, and after the
death of her Husband, the Heir shall not, without the Assent of the
woman, present a Parson to such Church. From the generality of this
Rule we must except the Capital Messuage, which cannot be given in
Dower, nor can it be divided, but shall remain entire.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Nor shall
a division be made of those things which other women, who have been
previously endowed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">-109-</span> still hold in Dower.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Besides, if there should
be two or more Manors to be divided, the Chief Manor shall not be
divided, but, together with the capital Messuage, shall remain entire
to the Heir, so that the Widow shall be fully satisfied from the other
Manor or Manors. It should also be remarked, that the Assignment of the
Dower shall not be postponed, on account of the Infancy of the Heir.
In addition, should any Land have been given by name to a Woman, in
Dower, and should a Church have been founded in that Fee, the Woman,
after the death of her Husband, shall have the free Presentation; so
as to have it in her power, in case such Church should become vacant,
to bestow it upon any proper Clerk.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> But she cannot confer it upon
a College,<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> because, by so doing, she would for ever destroy the
Right of the Heir.</p>

<p>But if the Husband of the woman happen in his lifetime to bestow the
Church upon the Clerk, the latter shall, during the whole of his
life, retain such Church; although he were presented subsequently
to the period when the woman was endowed of that Land. If, however,
the Husband should, in the interval, bestow the Church upon any
religious House, the Church ought, after the death of the Husband, to
be delivered to his Widow, so that in the course of her life she may
have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">-110-</span> a free Presentation.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> But, after the death of the woman, and
of the Clerk instituted Parson upon her Presentation, the Church shall
revert to the religious House, and shall for ever after so remain. It
may also be observed, that if the wife should, in the lifetime of her
Husband, be separated from him on account of incontinence, the Woman
shall not be heard upon a claim of Dower.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> The same rule prevails,
if she be separated from him on account of Relationship<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>—she
shall be debarred from claiming her Dower. And yet her children may
inherit, and, by the Law of the Realm, shall succeed to their Father
by hereditary Right.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">-111-</span> Observe also, that when the Son and Heir of
any one marries, with the consent of his Father, and, by the Assignment
of his Father, endow his Wife with a certain part of the Land of his
Father,<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> it may be questioned whether the Wife can demand any more
as dower?<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> If her Husband die previously to his Father, it may be
doubted, whether she can retain the Land in question, as her Dower,
and whether the Father of her Husband be bound to warrant such Land to
her?<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">-112-</span> a woman have more Land in Dower than she ought, that is,

<h3><a id="BOOK7_CHAP_I"></a>CHAP. I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> term Dower is received in a different acceptation in the Roman
Code, according to which, that portion which is given to a Man with a
Woman is, properly speaking, termed Dower; but this corresponds with
what is usually called, Marriage-hood.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">-114-</span> freeman possessed
of Land may give a certain part of it with his Daughter, or with any
other Woman, in Marriage-hood, whether he has any Heir, or not; or
whether his Heir, supposing he has one, consent to such a disposition,
or not—nay, though the Heir expressly dissent from, and forbid it.
Every one may also give a certain part of his freehold Estate<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
to any person he chuses, in remuneration of his services, or to a
religious Establishment in Free-Alms;<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> that, if seisin follow up
the Donation, the Land shall perpetually remain to the person to whom
it is given and his Heirs, if the terms of the Gift go to that extent.
But, if such a Donation should not be followed up by seisin, nothing
can, after the death of the Donor, be claimed with effect in virtue of
it, contrary to the will of the Heir; because such a disposition is
usually interpreted by the Law of the Realm, rather as a naked promise,
than a real promise or donation. Though it is thus, generally speaking,
lawful for a man, in his lifetime, freely to dispose of the reasonable
part<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> of his Land,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">-115-</span> in such manner as he may feel inclined, yet the
same permission is not allowed to any one on his death-bed; because
the distribution of the Inheritance would, probably, be then highly
imprudent,<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> were such an indulgence conceded to men, who, in the
glow of a sudden impulse, not unfrequently lose both their memory and
reason.</p>

<p>Hence, it is to be presumed, that if a Man laboring under a mortal
disease, should then for the first time set about making a disposition
of his Land, a thing never thought of by him in the hour of health,
that the act is rather the result of the Mind’s Insanity than of its
deliberation. But yet a Gift of this description,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">-116-</span> if made to any one
by the last Will, shall be valid, if done with the consent of the Heir,
and confirmed by his acquiescence in it. When a Man gives part of his
Land in Marriage-hood, or in any other manner, his Land consists either
of that which is inheritable only, or of that which he has purchased
only, or of both descriptions. If he possess inheritable Land only,
he may, as we have already observed, give a certain portion of it to
any stranger at his pleasure.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> But if he has many sons born in
Wedlock,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> he cannot, correctly speaking, without the consent of his
Heir, give any part of his Inheritance to a younger son; because, if
this were permitted, it would then frequently happen that the Eldest
son would be disinherited, owing to the greater affection which Parents
often feel towards their younger children.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, whether a man, having a Son and Heir, can give
any part of his Inheritance to his illegitimate son? If he can, it
follows, that the condition of the illegitimate son would, in this
respect, be preferable to that of the younger son born in Wedlock;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">-117-</span>
and yet the Law is so.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> But, if the person, desirous of making a
donation of part of his Lands, possess only such as he has purchased,
he may then make such Gift; provided it does not extend to the whole
of his purchased Lands, because he cannot disinherit his Son and
Heir.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Yet, if he has not any Heir, male or female, of his own
Body, he may, indeed, consult his own inclination in making an absolute
gift, either of part or of the whole of his purchased Lands.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> And,
if the person to whom the gift be made obtain Seisin of it, during
the life of the Donor, it is not in the power of any more remote<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
Heir to invalidate such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">-118-</span> Gift. Thus may a man give, in his lifetime,
the whole of his purchased Land; but he cannot make any one his Heir
to it, neither a College, nor any particular individual, it being an
Established Rule of Law, that God alone, and not Man, can make an
Heir.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> If, however, a Man possess both inheritable and purchased
Lands, it is then unquestionably true, that he may absolutely give any
part or the whole of the latter to such person as he pleases;<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> and
of his inheritance he may notwithstanding dispose, according to what
we have already observed, provided such disposition be a reasonable
one. It should be observed, that, if a Man, having Lands in free
socage,<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> has many sons, who are all in equal proportions to be
admitted to the Inheritance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">-119-</span> then, it is unquestionably true, that
their Father cannot give a greater part of his inheritable Land or of
his purchased, if he possess no inheritable, to any one of the sons,
than the reasonable part which would fall to such son of the whole
paternal Inheritance.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> But the Father can in his lifetime give to
either of his Sons such a part only of his inheritable free socage
Land, as such son would be intitled to upon the death of his father by
the Rule of succession. Yet, by reason of the liberality which Parents
are in the habit of exercising towards their sons, or even towards
other persons, questions of Law frequently arise concerning donations
of this description. Let us suppose, that a Knight or a freeman, having
four, or a greater number of sons, all born in Wedlock of one Mother,
should, with the consent of the Heir previously obtained, (in order to
prevent disputes) give to one of his sons—let us say, to the second
and his Heirs, a certain reasonable part of his Inheritance—Let us
suppose, that the son, to whom the Gift has been made, received Seisin,
and, during his Life, took the profits and proceeds, and that he died
in such Seisin, leaving not only his Father, but all his Brothers yet
living.</p>

<p>Very obscure, indeed, is the Law, and considerable the debate and
contention among the most skilful of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">-120-</span> that Profession, when this point
occurs or may occur in the King’s Court, in order to ascertain, who
ought by law to succeed to the Inheritance. The Father contends, that
he ought to retain to himself the Seisin of his departed son, and thus
desires, that the Land which had emanated from his Bounty should again
return to him. Upon this question being agitated in Court, the Eldest
son will answer to the Father, in the act of claiming the Land, that
the latter ought not to be heard upon the subject, as it is a general
principle of the Law of the Realm, that no one can be at once Lord and
Heir of the same Tenement.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> But, by force of the same principle,
the third son attempts to repel the Eldest son, from the inheritance in
question.</p>

<p>For, since the Eldest son is the Heir to the whole Inheritance, he
cannot be at once Lord of it and Heir; especially, if the father of
the Eldest son happen to be dead, such son would be Lord of the whole
Inheritance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">-121-</span> But, then, by the Law of the Realm, the Land cannot
remain to him, for the reason we have mentioned. If, therefore, he
cannot retain it absolutely, how can he claim it by the rule of
succession? By a parity of reasoning it seems, that the third son shall
exclude all the others.</p>

<p>A similar doubt arises, when any one has conceded and given a certain
portion of his Land to his younger Brother, and his Heirs. Let us
suppose, that the latter dies, without leaving any Heir of his own
body, and the former seizes into his own hands the Land of his deceased
Brother, as being vacant and within his Fee, against whom his own two
sons pray an Assise, concerning the death of their Uncle. Upon the
suit proceeding, the Eldest son may plead against his Father, and the
youngest son against his Elder Brother, in the manner before mentioned.
But it is evident, that the Father cannot by any means, consistently
with the Law of the Realm, retain the Land in question, as he cannot at
once be Lord and Heir. Nor, indeed, does the Law admit of Land so given
again reverting to the Donor, when Homage has followed the Gift,<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
if the person to whom the Gift is made has any Heir, of his own body,
or even more remote. Besides, Land which is thus given, like certain
other Inheritances, naturally descends to the Heirs by the rule of
succession, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">-122-</span> never naturally ascends.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Thus the Plea, between
the Father and the Eldest son, shall cease—but it shall proceed,
between the Eldest son and the youngest, in the manner we have already
described.</p>

<p>But, when this last case has occurred in the King’s Court, it has
sometimes been ordered by the Court, acting upon equitable principles,
that the Land so given should remain to the Eldest son, especially if
he has not any other Fee in possession, until the paternal Inheritance
fall to him. Because, in the mean time, as he is not the Lord of the
paternal Inheritance, the Rule, that no one can at once be Heir and
Lord, does not stand in his way. But since by the Rule of succession,
he must become Lord of that part of the Inheritance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">-123-</span> it may be asked,
whether he is not to be considered as Heir of the part in question,
when he is Heir of the whole Inheritance? To this we answer, that it
is as yet uncertain and in contingency, whether the Eldest son will be
the Heir or not. If, indeed, his Father should die before him, then it
is no longer doubtful, because he is his Heir. Should it so happen, he
ceases to be the Owner of the Land he formerly acquired by succeeding
to his Uncle; and, then, such Land shall descend to the younger son,
as the right Heir. If, however, the Eldest son should die before his
Father, it is, then, equally clear, that he will not be the future
Heir of his Father; and, therefore, those two accidents of Law, the
Hereditary Right and Dominion<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> never concur in his person. It
should be remarked, that Bishops and Abbots cannot, without the consent
and confirmation of the King, make an absolute disposition of any part
of their Demesnes, their Baronies being held in Frankalmoigne of the
Gift of the King and his Ancestors.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

Heirs are those of his Body, as a Son, or a Daughter.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Upon the
failure of these, the more remote Heirs are called, namely, the
Grandson, or Granddaughter descending in a right line from the Son
or Daughter, <i><span lang="la">in infinitum</span></i>. Then the Brother and Sister, and
those descending from them in a transverse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">-125-</span> line. After these, the

like manner the Aunt, and their Descendants.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>When, therefore, a Man possessed of an Inheritance dies, leaving one
Son only his Heir, it is unquestionably true, that such son shall
succeed entirely to his Father. If, however, he leaves more sons, then,
a distinction must be made, whether the deceased was a Knight, or one
holding by Military Tenure, or whether he was a Free Sockman.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
Because, if he were a Knight, or holding by Military Tenure, then,
according to the Law of the English Realm, his Eldest son shall
succeed to the whole Inheritance, so that none of his Brothers can
by right claim any part of it.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> But, if the Parent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">-126-</span> were a free
Sockman,<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> then, indeed, the Inheritance shall be equally divided
amongst all the sons, however numerous, provided such Socage Land has
been anciently divisible,<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> reserving, however, to the Eldest son<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">-127-</span>
as a mark of respect to his seniority,<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> the Capital Messuage, upon
his making a Compensation to the others equal to the value.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> If,
however, the Estate was not anciently divisible, then, the Eldest son
shall, according to some customs, take the whole Inheritance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">-128-</span> whilst,
according to other Customs, the younger son shall succeed as Heir.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
In like manner, should any person leave one Daughter only, his Heir,
then what we have laid down with respect to a son shall unquestionably
prevail. If, however, he leave more Daughters, then, the Inheritance
shall, without distinction, be divided between them, whether their
Father was a Knight or a Sockman, reserving to the Eldest Daughter, the
Capital Messuage, under the conditions before mentioned. But it should
be observed, if either of the Brothers or Sisters, amongst whom the
Inheritance is divided, should die, without leaving any Heir of his
or her Body, then the portion of the person so dying shall be divided
amongst the survivors. But the Husband of the Eldest Daughter shall
do Homage<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> to the Chief Lord for the whole Fee. But the Younger
Daughters, or their Husbands, are bound to perform to the Chief Lord
the services due for their Land, by the hand of the Eldest Daughter, or
her Husband. Yet the Husbands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">-129-</span> of the Younger Daughters are not bound
to perform any Homage, or even Fealty, to the Husband of the Eldest
Daughter, in her lifetime.</p>

<p>Nor are their Heirs in the first and second degrees; but those in
the third descent from the Younger Daughters are bound by the Law of
the Realm, to do Homage for their Tenement to the Heir of the Eldest
Daughter, and to pay a reasonable Relief.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> In addition it should
be known, that Husbands cannot give any part of the Inheritance of
their Wives, without the consent of their Heirs, nor can they remit
any part of the right of the Heirs, unless in her lifetime.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> If,
however, a Man leaves a son and Heir, and has besides one Daughter
or more, the son succeeds entirely to the Inheritance—from whence it
follows, that if a Man should have married many Wives,<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> and by each
of them have had one or more Daughters, and at length an only son by
the last of them, the son alone shall obtain the Inheritance of the
Father; because, it is a general Rule, that a Female can never share
an Inheritance with a Male, unless perhaps a special Exception to
this exist in some particular City, grounded upon a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">-130-</span> Custom which has
long prevailed there. But, if a man should marry different Women, and
by each of them should have one Daughter, or more, all the Daughters
are equally entitled to the Inheritance of the Father, in the same
manner as if they were all sprung from the same Mother.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> But when
a Man dies without leaving any Son, or Daughter, his Heir, if he has
any Grand Children, then, undoubtedly, they shall succeed to him, in
the same manner as we have above mentioned, his Son or Daughter would
have succeeded, and under similar distinctions. For the Descendants
in the right line, are always to be preferred to those who are in the
tranverse line. But when any one dies, leaving a younger son, and a
Grandson, the Child of his Eldest son, great doubt exists, as to which
of the two the Law prefers in the succession to the other, whether the
Son or the Grandson. Some think, the Younger Son has more right to the
Inheritance than such Grandson, for this reason—that the Eldest Son did
not survive his Father, and was not in existence when the Inheritance
fell, but the Younger Son did out-live both his Brother and his Father,
and it is, therefore, right, as they contend, that he should succeed
to his Father. But others incline to think, that the Grandson ought of
right to be preferred to his Uncle.</p>

<p>For since the Grandson descended from the Eldest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">-131-</span> Son and is the Heir
of his Body, he would have succeeded to all his Father’s rights had
he still lived, and he ought therefore to succeed. In which opinion I
concur, if his Father was not portioned off<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> by the Grandfather.</p>

<p>For a Son may, in the lifetime of his Father, be portioned off by
him, if the father assigns a certain part of his Land to the Son,
and deliver him Seisin in his lifetime, at the request and with the
unrestrained consent of the Son, in such manner, that the latter be
fully satisfied with such part. In such case, the Heirs of the Son’s
Body, cannot claim, as against their Uncle, or any other person, any
greater portion of the residue of the Grandfather’s Inheritance, than
the part of their Father, although the Father himself might, if he had
survived the Grandfather. Besides, if the Eldest Son, after having in
his Father’s lifetime done Homage to the Chief Lord for his paternal
Inheritance, should die before his Father, there is no question but
that his Son shall be preferred to the Uncle. Upon this subject,
however, a contest may arise, between the Grandson and the Chief Lord,
if the latter refuse the Homage of the Grandson; or between the Chief
Lord and the Uncle, if the Chief Lord has warranted the Homage of the
Grandson. In both these cases, there is no reasonable objection to
prevent the matter coming to the Duel, unless the Homage can be proved;
for then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">-132-</span> indeed, (as the Law now obtains between the Uncle and the
Grandson) <i><span lang="la">Melior est conditio possidentis</span></i>.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

to be called; and, these being dead, their children are to be called.
After these, the Uncles are to be called, and their children; and,
lastly, recourse must be had to the Aunts, or their children; the
distinction above-mentioned being always observed and kept in view,
between the sons of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">-133-</span> Knight, and of a Sockman, and in like manner,

<h3>CHAP. V.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Heirs</span> are also bound to observe the Testaments of their Fathers, and of
their other Ancestors. Of such, I mean, to whom they are Heirs; and to
discharge their Debts. For every Freeman, not involved in Debt beyond
his circumstances, may on his death-bed make a reasonable division<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
of his Effects, under this form, as prescribed by the custom of certain
places. In the first place, he should remember his Lord, by the Gift
of the best and chief thing he possesses: then the<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Church, and
afterwards other persons at his pleasure. But, whatever the Custom of
different places inculcate with reference to this point, yet, according
to the Law of the Realm, no man is bound to leave any thing by Will to
any person in particular, unless it be his inclination; for every Man’s
last Will is said to be free, according to the spirit of these Laws, as
well as others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">-134-</span></p>

<p>A woman, indeed, when at her own disposal, may make a Testament; but,
if married, she cannot, without the Authority of her Husband, make
any Will of the Effects of her Husband.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Yet it would be a mark
of affection and highly creditable to the Husband, if he concede a
reasonable portion of his Effects to his Wife; in other words, a third
part, which, indeed, she would be entitled to, should she out-live him,
as will be more fully seen hereafter. Husbands indeed, much to their
honor, frequently grant to their Wives this indulgence.</p>

<p>When, therefore, any one being indisposed wishes to make his Will, if
he be not involved in Debt, all his moveables should be divided into
three equal parts; of which one belongs to his Heir,<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> another to
his Wife, and the third is reserved to himself.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Of this third, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">-135-</span>
has the free power of disposing. But, if he dies without leaving any
Wife, the half is reserved to him.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">-136-</span> But of his Inheritance, he

<h3>CHAP. IX.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> leads us to observe, that some Heirs are evidently of Age, some as
clearly not of full age, but others of whom it may be doubtful, whether
they have attained their age or not. The first description of Heirs
may, immediately upon the deaths of their Ancestors, hold themselves in
possession of their Inheritance,<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> although their Lords may take the
Fee, together with the Heir, into their hands. This, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">-139-</span> ought
to be done with such moderation, as not to cause any Disseisin to the
Heirs, who may, indeed, should it be necessary, resist the violence of
their Lords, provided they are prepared to pay their Reliefs, and to
render to them such other services as are justly due. But, if it be
evident that the Heir is under age, and he hold by Military service, he
is considered to be in the Custody<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> of his Lord, until he attains
his full age.</p>

<p>The full age of an Heir, if the son of a Knight, or of one holding by
Military service, is when he has completed his twenty-first Year.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
But, if the Heir be the Son of a Sockman, he is esteemed to be of full
age when he has completed his fifteenth Year.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> If he is the son of
a Burgess, he is understood to have attained his full age,<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> when he
has discretion to count Money and measure Cloth, and in like manner to
manage his Father’s other concerns.</p>

<p>In so extensive a sense have Lords the Custody of the Sons and Heirs
of their Homagers and of their Fee, that they, for example, exercise
an absolute controul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">-140-</span> with respect to presenting to Churches in their
Custody, in marrying Females, (if they fall into wardship), and in
regulating other matters, in the same manner as if they were their
own. The Law, however, does not permit the Lords to make any absolute
disposition of the Inheritance. In the mean time, the Lord should
maintain the Heir in a manner suitable to his Dignity and the extent of
his Inheritance, and should discharge the Debts of the deceased, so far
as the Estate and the length of the Custody will admit.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Hence they
are bound by the Law to answer the Debts of the Ancestors.</p>

<p>The Lords may also manage the concerns of the Heir, and commence
and prosecute all Suits for the recovery of his rights, provided no
exception be taken on account of the Minor’s Age.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> But the Lord is
not bound to answer for the Heir, neither in a question of Right nor
of Disseisin, except in one instance—when one Minor has the Custody of
another, after the decease of his Father. Should the latter Minor, upon
his attaining his full age, be refused his Inheritance, he may have
an Assise and Recognition of the Death of his Ancestor; nor shall the
Recognition, in such case,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">-141-</span> cease, on Account of the Minority of the
Lord. But if a Minor be appealed of any Felony,<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> then he shall be
attached by safe and secure pledges. Yet, whilst he continues within
age, he shall not be compelled to answer, nor until he has attained his
full age. Those persons who have the Custody are bound to restore the
Inheritance to the Heirs in good condition,<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> and discharged from
Debts, in proportion to the duration of the Custody, and the extent of
the Inheritance. But if it be doubtful, whether the Heir be of full age
or a Minor, then, undoubtedly, the Lord shall have the Custody as well
of the Heir as of his Inheritance, until the full age of the Heir be
reasonably proved by the oaths of lawful men of the Vicinage.</p>

<h3>CHAP. X.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> those Heirs, liable to be in Custody, have more Lords than one, the
chief Lord, that is, the one to whom the Heir owes allegiance for his
first Fee, shall have the Custody. But this is not to deprive the Lords
of the other Fees of their Beliefs and rightful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">-142-</span> services; but the
Custody shall remain to them entire, under the form before mentioned.
Yet should it be observed, that when any one hold of the King <i><span lang="la">in
Capite</span></i>, the Custody of him belongs exclusively to the King, whether
the Heir has any other Lords or not; because the King<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> can have
no equal, much less a superior.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> But yet, by reason of Burgage
Tenure,<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> the King is not preferred in the Custody to others. If the
King should commit the Custody to another,<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> then, a distinction
is to be made, whether it is unconditionally, and in such manner as
not to render the person to whom it was committed accountable to the
Exchequer, or whether it is under restrictions. If it is committed
to him in such unconditional manner, then he can present to vacant
Churches, and, generally, as far as consistent with Justice, manage the
concerns of the Heir, as if they were his own.</p>

if the Inheritance itself descended from the paternal side, the Custody
shall be conferred upon the kindred, the descendants on the maternal
side; but, if the Inheritance descend on the part of the Mother, then
the Custody belongs to the Kindred on the Father’s side. For the
custody of a person shall never by Law be committed to another, of whom
a suspicion can be entertained, that he either could or might wish to
claim any right in the Inheritance itself.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<h3>CHAP. XII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> if the Heirs are females, they shall remain in the Custody of their
Lords. If they are Minors, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">-144-</span> shall continue in Custody until they
are of full age,<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> at which period the Lord is bound to find them
a Marriage, delivering to each of them her reasonable portion. But
if they were of full age, then also they shall remain in the Custody
of their Lord, until with his Advice and disposal they are married;
because without the disposal or assent of her Lord no female, the Heir
to Land,<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> can by the Law and Custom of the Realm be married.</p>

<p>Hence it is, that if a Man, having only a Daughter or Daughters, his
Heirs, should in his lifetime marry off one or more of them without
the assent of the Lord, he is justly, according to the Law and Custom
of the Realm, for ever deprived of his Inheritance; and that in such
manner, that he can never afterwards recover any part of it, unless
by the indulgence of the Lord. The reason is simply this—that as
the Husband of an Heiress is bound to do Homage to the Lord for her
Estate, the approbation and consent of the Lord is requisite for such
purpose; least he should be compelled to receive from his Enemy, or
from some other improper person, the Homage due in respect of his
Fee.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> But if any one demands of his Lord a License<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">-145-</span> to marry his
Daughter and Heir to another, the Lord is bound either to consent,
or to shew some just cause, why he refuses;<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> otherwise the woman
may, with the advice and approbation of her Father, be married, even
contrary to the Lord’s inclination. Upon this occasion it may be asked,
if a Woman, having Lands in Dower, may, without the consent of her
Warrantor,<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> follow her own inclination in marrying another; and,
if she do so, whether she shall on that account lose her whole Dower?
It does not appear that she ought for that reason to lose her Dower,
since her Husband, by the Law and Custom of the Realm, owes no Homage
to her Warrantor, but merely Fealty with an Oath, least if the Woman
herself should die before her Husband, the Homage should be entirely
lost, no Tenure being retained. Yet the Woman is bound to obtain the
consent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">-146-</span> of her Warrantor to her marriage, or she shall lose her
Dower,<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> unless, indeed, she holds other Land in Marriage-hood or
by Inheritance; for then it suffices, if she has obtained the consent
of the Chief Lord. This Rule obtains not on account of the Homage
but of the other Fealty, which the Husband is bound to perform to
the Lord as we have observed. But, if the Inheritance be within the
Fees of many different Lords, it is then sufficient, if the consent
of the Chief Lord be obtained to the Marriage of the female Heir. If
female Heirs, during such time as they are in Custody, are guilty
of incontinence,<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> and this be proved, then, those who have thus
erred shall be excluded from the Inheritance; and their portion shall
accrue to the others, who are free from the same stain. But if, in
this manner, all of them should err, then, the whole Inheritance shall
devolve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">-147-</span> upon the Lord, as an Escheat. Yet, if such female Heirs are
once lawfully married, and afterwards become widows, they shall not
again be under the Custody of their Lords; although they are, for
the reason formerly explained, bound to ask his consent to their
marriage.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Nor, in such case, shall they forfeit their Inheritance,
if guilty of incontinence.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>But the assertion which is generally made, that incontinence<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> is no
forfeiture of the Inheritance, is to be understood of the crime of the
Mother; because, that Son is the lawful Heir, whom marriage proves to
be such.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

without leaving any Heir of his own Body, who is entitled by law to
succeed to him, as his Lord cannot for the reasons before stated?<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
But when any one dies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">-151-</span> intestate, all his chattels are understood to
belong to his Lord; and, if he has more Lords than one, each of them
shall recover such Chattels, as may be found within his Fee. But all
the Effects of a Usurer (whether he make a Will or not) belong to the
King.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> But it is not the Custom for any one, whilst living, to be
appealed or convicted of the crime of Usury—but, among other Regal
Inquisitions, it is usually inquired<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">-152-</span> and proved, who have died in
this Offence,<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> and that by the oaths of twelve lawful Men of the
Vicinage. Which being proved in Court, all the Moveables and Chattels
which belonged to the deceased Usurer shall be seised to the King’s
use, without any regard to the person in whose hands they may be found.
His Heir is for the same reason deprived of the Inheritance according
to the Law of the Realm, the Inheritance itself reverting to the
Lord. It should, however, be observed, that if any one has, during a
certain period of his life, been guilty of this Crime, and be publicly
accused<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> of it in the Community where he lived, if he desisted
from his error before his death, and was penitent, neither he, nor his
property, shall after his death be liable to the penalties of Usury.
It ought, therefore, to be evident,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">-153-</span> that a Man has died a Usurer,
in order that he may be so adjudged after his death, and his Effects
disposed of as those of a Usurer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Ultimate Heir of any person is his Lord.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> When, therefore, a
Man dies without leaving any certain Heir, such, for example, as a
Son, or Daughter, or without any such Heir of whom there can exist
no doubt,<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> but that he is the nearer and right Heir, the Lords
of the Fee may, and indeed, usually do, take the Vacant Inheritances
into their hands, and retain them as Escheats,<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> whoever such
Lord may be, whether the King, or any other person. But, if any one
appear and assert himself to be the right Heir, if by the indulgence
of his Lord, or by the King’s precept, he can effect it, he shall
prosecute his claim; and thus he may establish his right, if he has
any such; but, in the mean time, the Land in question shall remain in
the hands of the Lord of the Fee: because, whenever a Lord entertains
a doubt concerning the Heir of his Tenant, whether he be the right
Heir or not, he may retain the Land until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">-154-</span> the fact be lawfully
proved to him.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> The same rule is laid down, in a former part of
this Treatise, where a doubt arises with respect to the full age or
Minority of the Heir. There is, however, this difference, that in the
one case, the Inheritance itself is in the mean time to be considered
as the Lord’s Escheat: but in the other case, it is not considered to
be the Lord’s—nothing, indeed, but the Custody. But if no one should
appear to claim the Inheritance in question as Heir, then it shall
absolutely revert to the Lord as an Escheat; so that he may dispose of
it at his pleasure as his own property. Besides, if a Female Heir, in
the Custody of her Lord, be guilty of Incontinence, her Inheritance
shall escheat to her Lord, on account of her crime. And if any person
be convicted of Felony, or confess his Guilt in Court, deprived by
the Law of the Realm of his Inheritance, his Land shall remain to
the Lord, as an Escheat.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> It is to be observed, that if any one
hold of the King <i><span lang="la">in Capite</span></i>, then, as well his Land, as all his
Moveables and Chattels, in whose-ever possession they may be found,
shall be seised to the King’s use, and the Heir shall be for ever
debarred from recovering them. But if an outlaw,<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> or one convicted
of Felony, hold of any other person than the King, then also all his
Moveables shall belong to the King; his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">-155-</span> Lands also shall remain in
the King’s hands during one year, which period being expired, such
Land shall revert to the right Lord, in other words, to him to whose
Fee it belongs, the Houses, however, being thrown down, and the Trees
extirpated.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> And, generally speaking, whenever a person has done
or said any thing in Court for which he has been, by a Judgment of the
Court, disinherited, his Inheritance is accustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">-156-</span> to return as an
Escheat to the Lord of the Fee of whom it is held. But a forfeiture,
committed by the Son and Heir of any one, shall not disinherit the
Father, nor the Brother, nor, indeed, any other person but himself.
It should also be added, that when a Man has been condemned of Theft,
all his Moveables and Chattels generally devolve on the Sheriff of
the County; but his Land, if he has any, shall immediately revert to
the Lord of the Fee, without awaiting the year.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> When any one
has been outlawed by the Law of the Land, and has afterwards, by the
indulgence of the Prince, been restored to the Peace, he cannot on
that account recover his Inheritance, supposing that he or his Heirs
possess such, as against his Lord (unless by the mercy and indulgence
of the Lord himself.) The King, indeed, is accustomed to remit the
pains of Forfeiture and Outlawry, yet cannot he, under colour of this
prerogative, infringe upon the rights of others.</p>

<h3><a id="BOOK7_CHAP_XVIII"></a>CHAP. XVIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> Marriage-hood—the one kind is free, the other, liable to the
performance of services.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Marriage-hood is called free, when any
freeman gives a certain part of his Land with a Woman in Marriage to
another, so that such Land be exempt from every kind of service,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">-157-</span> and
acquitted on the part of him and his Heirs, as against the Chief Lord.
The Land in question shall enjoy this immunity, even to the third
Heir;<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> nor, during the interval, are the Heirs bound to do any
Homage for it; but, after the third Heir,<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> the Land again becomes
subject to its original services, and Homage shall be received for it,
and, if it be part of a Military Fee, the Tenant shall perform the
service of the Fee, with reference to the quantity of the Land. But
sometimes Land is given in Marriage-hood, saving and reserving the
services due to the Chief<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Lord; and then indeed, the Husband of
the Woman and his Heirs must perform the services, with the Exception
of Homage, even to the third Heir.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>But the third Heir shall do Homage for the first time, and all his
Heirs afterwards. But another Fealty,<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> with the interposition of a
solemn promise or oath, shall, in the intervening period, be performed
by the Women and their Heirs, almost in the same form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">-158-</span> and in the same
words in which Homage is commonly performed.</p>

<p>When, therefore, any one has received Lands with his Wife in
Marriage-hood, and has by her an Heir, Male or Female, heard to cry
within the four Walls, then, if the man survive his wife, whether the
Heir live or not, the Marriage-hood shall notwithstanding remain to the
Husband, during his life; but, after his death, it shall revert to the
original Donor, or his Heirs.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> But if he never had an Heir from his
Wife, then, immediately after her death, the Marriage-hood shall revert
to the Donor or his Heirs.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">-159-</span></p>

<p>And this is some reason why Homage is not usually received for Lands in
Marriage-hood.</p>

<p>For if Land were so given in Marriage-hood, or in any other way, that
Homage was received for it, then, it would never afterwards revert to
the Donor, or his Heirs, as we have explained. If, however, such Woman
take a second Husband, the same Rule prevails, as to the second, as we
have stated concerning the first, whether the first should have left
an Heir or not. But when any one sues for Land as the Marriage-hood of
his Wife, or when the Woman or her Heir does so, then, a distinction
must be made, whether the Land is demanded as against the Donor, or his
Heir, or against a stranger. If the Suit be against the Donor, or his
Heir, then, it is at the Election of the Demandant, whether he would
proceed in the Court Christian, or in the Secular Court.</p>

<p>For if the Demandant chuses to resort to such Tribunal, it belongs to
the Ecclesiastical Judge to hold pleas of Marriage-hood; a Jurisdiction
he acquires from the mutual Troth usually plighted, when any one
promises to marry a Woman, and she in her turn promises marriage to
him. Nor, indeed, is the Ecclesiastical Judge prohibited by the King’s
Court from holding such plea, although it concern a Lay-fee, if it be
clear that the demand relate to Marriage. But if the Suit be brought
against a Stranger, then, indeed, it shall be determined in the Lay
Court, and that, in the same manner and order in which Pleas concerning
other Lay Fees are generally conducted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">-160-</span></p>

<p>Yet, should it be observed, that the Suit ought not to be proceeded
in, without the Warrantor, as we formerly mentioned when treating of
Dower. The Suit, indeed, must be proceeded in, as far as respects the
Warrantor, in the same manner as a Plea in Dower. What we, therefore,
said on the former occasion with respect to this point, is applicable
to the present. It remains to add, that the third Heir, after he has
once done Homage, can<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> proceed in the suit without the authority of
the Warrantor.</p>

the general consent of the persons interested, usually reduced into

of them fail to adhere to it, or to perform his part of it, and the

<h3>CHAP. V.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Should</span> the party, thus summoned, neither appear, nor essoin himself, on
the day appointed, or if, after having cast three Essoins, he neither
appear, nor send an Attorney, the course in such case to be pursued
has been already pointed out, in that part of this Treatise which
applies to Pleas, where the Pledges are to be attached, and in the
<a href="#Book_I">first Book</a>. Both parties being present in Court, if each of them should
acknowledge the writing (containing the Concord made between them)
or if the Concord is stated to be such by the King’s Justices before
whom it was made, and this be properly testified by their Record, then
the Party who has broken the Concord shall be amerced to the King,
and shall be safely attached, until he find good security that he
will from thenceforth keep the Concord, by adhering to its terms, if
possible, or will otherwise make his Adversary a reasonable recompense.
For, it is a consequence which naturally results from acknowledging a
fact in the King’s Court in the presence of the King or his Justices,
or undertaking to do any particular Act, that the Party should be
compelled to abide by or perform it. If, however, such a Concord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">-168-</span> be
made in a suit concerning Land, then, the party convicted in Court, or
confessing that he had not properly observed the Fine, if a Tenant,
shall thereby lose his Land, but, if a Demandant, his Suit. But if
the parties, either the one or the other of them, deny the Common
Chirograph, then, the same Justices shall be summoned to appear on a
day appointed to them in Court, and there record, how the suit came to
an end which was before them in the King’s Court, between such and such
parties, of so much Land, in that Vill, which the one claimed against
the other; and, if the parties, by the license of the Justices and in
their presence, came to an agreement, under what form the Concord was
made. But here a distinction must be taken, whether such Concord was
made in the King’s chief Court, or before the Justices Itinerant.</p>

<p>In the latter case, such Justices must be summoned to appear in Court,
with certain discreet Knights, of the County where the Concord in
question was made, who were present when it was entered into, and know
the truth of the fact; in order that such Justices may make a Record
of the Suit, with the assistance of the Knights, who are to be called
to Court for that purpose, from the whole body of the County, by the
following Writ——</p>

to record, with discreet Knights of that County, how the Plea of one
Hyde of Land, which <i>N.</i> claimed against <i>R.</i>, in that Vill,
and of which there was a Suit before them, on their Eyre, ceased in
my Court.” The Sheriff of the County, in which the Suit was decided
before the Justices, shall also be commanded to transmit at the same
time a Record of the Suit in question to the King, or his Justices, by
the hands of discreet Knights of his County. This shall be done by the

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Justices being present in Court, and perfectly concurring as to the

be ascertained, then, the Plea must be again commenced and proceeded on
in Court.</p>

<hr class="short">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">-170-</span></p>


<h3>CHAP. IX.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> should be understood, that no Court, generally speaking, has a
Record, except the King’s Court.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> For in other Courts, if a Man
should say a thing, which he would afterwards retract, he may deny<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
it against the whole Court, by the oath of three witnesses, affirming
that he had not said the thing imputed to him, or, indeed, by a greater
or less number of witnesses, according to the custom of different
Courts. Yet, in some cases, the County and other inferior Courts are
by a particular Law of the Realm allowed to have Records; thus, if
the Duel has been waged in any inferior Court, and the Suit should be
afterwards transferred into the King’s Court; then, as to the claim of
the Demandant, the defence of the Tenant, and the words in which such
Duel was adjudged and waged, the former Court shall have its Record
even in the King’s Court; but, in other respects, such inferior Court
has no Record, unless concerning the change of a Champion. For if,
after the suit has been transferred into the King’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">-171-</span> Court, a different
Champion should be produced, than the one who has waged the Duel in
the inferior Court, and a dispute arise upon this point, the Record of
the inferior Court shall by a Law of the Realm be conclusive upon the
subject. It should also be understood, with respect to the Record of
an inferior Court, that any one may add, that he had said more than
is contained in such Record—and that he did in Court say it, he may
prove against the whole Court, by the oaths of two or more lawful Men,
according as the custom of different Courts vary; because no Court is
bound, either to prove or defend its Record by the Duel. But it is
not allowed to any one to take exceptions against one part, and admit
the other; and this rule is grounded on a Law of the Realm: since he
may from the first deny the whole Record, an oath being taken in the
manner before mentioned. But, although a Court is not obliged to defend
its Record by the Duel, yet is it bound to defend its Judgment by the
Duel.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> If, therefore, any one should declare against the Court for
passing a false Judgment, and, therefore false, because when one party
had said thus, and the other answered thus, the Court in question had
judged falsely of their allegations by deciding in such words; and that
the Court had given such false Judgment by the mouth of <i>N.</i>; and,
if he were disposed to deny the present charge, the other was prepared
to prove it against him, chiefly by such proper witness, who was ready
to enter upon the proof. Thus may the matter, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">-172-</span> that very properly,
be decided by the Duel.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> But, whether such Court is obliged to
defend itself by one of its own members, or may have recourse to a
stranger, may be questioned?</p>

<p>It ought, indeed, to defend itself chiefly by the person who has passed
the Judgment<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> and, if the Court should be convicted of the charge,
the Lord of the Court shall be amerced to the King, and shall for ever
be deprived of his Court. Besides which, the whole Court shall be
amerced to the King. But, if the person bringing the charge forward
should fail in his proof, he shall thereby lose his principal suit. A
Court may also have a Record, by the indulgence of the Prince. Thus, if
the King, influenced by some reasonable motive, should cause any Court
to be summoned to make a Record in his Court; so that the King chuses,

<p><span class="smcap">Inferior</span> Courts have also Records concerning things transacted in them,

difficulty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">-174-</span> arises, and the Court is incompetent to determine it. On
such an occasion, the Lord himself may adjourn his Court<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> into the
King’s Court, in order to have the advice and assent of the latter,
in determining what is proper to be done. The King, indeed, owes this
assistance to his Barons, who may on such an occasion, as a matter of
right, adjourn their Courts into the King’s Court, in order to obtain
from the skilful men who preside there, that advice they stand in need
of. But, when they have been certified in the King’s Court, concerning
the doubtful point, they may return with the Suit, resume the
consideration of it, and finally determine it in their own Court.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>

<h3>CHAP. I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> remains to resume the subject of performing Homages,<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> and
receiving Reliefs.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Upon the death of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">-176-</span> the Father, or any other
Ancestor, the Lord of the Fee is bound, from the first, to receive
the Homage of the Right Heir, whether the Heir has attained his full
age, or not, if he be a Male. For, Females cannot by Law perform any
Homage,<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> although, generally speaking, they are to do Fealty to
their Lords.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">-177-</span></p>

<p>But, if they are married, their Husbands ought to do Homage to their
Lords for their Fees; I mean, if Homage be due in respect of such Fees.
If, however, the Heir be a Male and a Minor, the Lord of the Fee is not
entitled by Law to the Custody, either of the Heir, or his Inheritance,
until he has received the Homage of the Heir; because, it is a general
principle, that no one can exact from an Heir, whether he is of age,
or not, any service, consisting in a Relief or otherwise, until he has
received the Homage of the Heir, in respect of that Tenement, for which
the service is claimed. But a person may perform Homage to several
Lords on account of different Fees; but, of these Homages, one should
be the chief, and accompanied with allegiance,<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> and this must be
made to the Lord, from whom the person performing Homage, holds his
Chief Estate. Homage ought to be done in this form, namely, the party
performing it shall so become the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">-178-</span> Man of his Lord, that he shall bear
faith to him for the Tenement in respect of which he does Homage,<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
and shall preserve the Lord’s terrene Honor in all things, saving the
faith due to the King,<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> and his Heirs.</p>

<p>From this it is evident, that a Vassal cannot injure his Lord,
consistently with the Faith implied in Homage; unless, possibly, in his
own defence, or unless, in compliance with the King’s precept, he join
his Army when it proceeds against his Lord; and, generally speaking, no
one can by Law, consistently with the Faith implied in Homage, do any
thing which tends to deprive his Lord of his Inheritance, or to affix
a personal stain upon him.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> If, then, a Tenant has in respect of
several Fees done Homage to different Lords, who afterwards make war on
each other; and the Chief Lord should command the Tenant to accompany
him in person against another of his Lords, he ought to yield<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">-179-</span>
obedience to this Mandate, saving however the service due to the other
Lord for the Fee held of him.</p>

<p>From what has gone before it is evident, that if a Tenant should do
any thing to the disinherison of his Lord, and should be convicted of
it, he and his Heirs shall according to the Law for ever lose the Fee
held of such Lord.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> The same consequence will follow, if the Tenant
lay violent hands on his Lord to hurt him, or to commit any atrocious
injury upon him, and this be lawfully proved in Court against the
Tenant. But, it may be asked, whether any one can be compelled in the
Lord’s Court, to defend himself against the Lord from such charges; and
whether his Lord can, by the Judgment of his own Court, distrain the
Tenant so to do, without the Precept of the King, or his Justices, or
without the King’s Writ, or that of his Chief Justice?</p>

<p>The Law, indeed, permits a Lord by the Judgment of his Court to call
upon and distrain his Homager to appear in Court, and, unless he can
purge himself against the charge of his Lord by three persons, or as
many as the Court should award, he shall be amerced to the Lord, to the
extent of the whole Fee that he holds of him.</p>

<p>It may also be enquired, whether a Lord can distrain his Homager
to appear in Court, and answer for a service,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">-180-</span> of which the former
complains the Tenant has deforced him, or of which some part is unpaid?</p>

<p>The Lord, indeed, by Law may well do so, even without the precept
of the King, or his Justices. And thus the Lord and his Homager may
proceed to the Duel, or the Grand Assise, by means of one of the
Peers,<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> who chuses to make himself a Witness<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> of the fact, as
having seen the Tenant himself, or his Ancestors, perform such service
for the Fee in dispute to the Lord or his Ancestors, and is prepared
to prove the fact. But, if the Tenant be convicted of this charge, he
shall by Law be disinherited of the whole Fee, which he holds of his
Lord. If, however, any one is unable to constrain his Tenants, it then
becomes necessary to have recourse to the Court.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Every free Male
person may perform Homage, whether of full age, or otherwise, whether
a Clergyman or Layman. But consecrated Bishops are not in the habit of
doing Homage to the King, even for their Baronies; but merely Fealty,
accompanied with an oath. But Bishops elect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">-181-</span> are accustomed to do
Homage, previous to their Consecration.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> Homage is due only for Lands, free Tenements, Services, Rents
in certain, whether in Money, or in other things. But, in respect
of Dominion<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> alone, Homage ought not to be rendered to any one,
except to the King. Yet Homage is not always performed for every
species of Land. Thus, it is not due for Land in Dower, nor for free
Marriage-hood, nor from the Fee of Younger Sisters holding of the
Eldest, within the third descent on both sides<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>; nor is it due
from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">-182-</span> Fee given in Free-Alms, nor for any Tenement given in any way
in Marriage-hood, as far as concerns the person of the Husband of the
Woman to whom the property belongs as her Marriage-hood.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> Homage may be done to any free person, whether Male or Female,
whether of full age or otherwise, whether Clergy or Lay. Yet should it
be understood, that if a person has done Homage for a Tenement to a
Woman who afterwards marries any man, he shall be compelled to repeat
it to her Husband for the same Tenement. But, if any one has by Concord
made in Court recovered a Tenement against another who had previously
paid a Relief for it to the Chief Lord, it may be questioned, whether
the person so recovering the Tenement ought to pay any Relief for
it.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. IV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Reciprocal</span>, indeed, ought to be the Relation of Fidelity between
Dominion and Homage.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Nor does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">-183-</span> the Tenant owe more to his Lord,
in respect of Homage, than the Lord owes to the Tenant on account
of Dominion, Reverence alone excepted. Hence, if one person give to
another any Land in return for Service and Homage, which is afterwards
recovered against the Tenant by a third person, the Lord shall be bound
to warrant such Land to him, or to return him an adequate equivalent.
It is different, however, with respect to him who holds a Fee of
another, as his Inheritance, and, in this character, has done Homage;
because although he lose the Land, the Lord shall not be bound to give
him an equivalent.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> In the case we have formerly mentioned, of the
death of the Father or Ancestor, leaving an Heir, a Minor, the Lord of
the Fee has no right to the Custody of the Heir, or his Inheritance,
unless he has first received the Homage of the Heir. But the Homage
having been received, the Heir, with his Inheritance, shall continue
in the manner before mentioned, in the Custody of his Lord, until he
has attained his full age. Having at last arrived at such age, and
received restitution of his Inheritance, he shall, by reason of his
having been in Custody, be exempt from the payment of any Relief.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
But a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">-184-</span> Female Heir, whether she has attained her full age, or not,
shall remain in the Custody of her Lord, until, with his advice,
she is married.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> If, however, she was within age, when the Lord
received her into Custody, then, upon her marriage, the Inheritance
shall be discharged from the Relief, so far as respects herself and her
Husband.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> But, if she was of full age at that time, although she
continue some time in her Lord’s Custody before she is married, her
Husband shall pay a Relief. When, however, the Relief has been once
paid by the Husband of a Woman, it shall exempt both the Husband and
the Wife during their several lives from payment of another Relief,
on account of such Inheritance; because, neither the Woman herself,
nor her second Husband, if she should espouse a second upon the death
of the former, nor her first Husband, should he survive her, shall
again pay a Relief for the same Land. But when a Male Heir is left
of full age, and known to be the Heir, he shall hold himself in his
Inheritance, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">-185-</span> we have formerly observed, even though his Lord be
unwilling, provided he make a Tender to his Lord, as he ought to do, of
his Homage, and reasonable Relief,<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> in the presence of creditable
persons. A person’s Relief is said to be reasonable, with reference to
the Custom of the Realm, according to which the Relief of a Knight’s
Fee is one hundred Shillings,<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> whilst that of Land in Socage is
one Year’s Value.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> But as to Baronies<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> nothing certain is
enacted,<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> because Barons holding of the King <i><span lang="la">in Capite</span></i> are
accustomed to pay their Reliefs to the King, according to his pleasure,
and indulgence.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> The same Rule prevails as to Serjeanties.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">-186-</span>
If, however, the Lord will neither receive the Homage nor reasonable
Relief of the Heir, then, the latter should safely keep the Relief, and
frequently tender it to his Lord, by the hands of respectable persons.
If the Lord will by no means receive it, then, the Heir should make
complaint of him to the King, or his Justices; and shall have the
following Writ.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. VI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> to the proceedings which are to be resorted to, in case the Lord
should not obey this Summons, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">-187-</span> means by which he shall be
distrained to appear in Court, they may be collected from the former
part of this Treatise. When, at last, he appears in Court, he will
either acknowledge that the Tenant is the right Heir, or deny that he
is the Heir, or he will doubt, whether he is the right Heir or not. If
he should acknowledge him to be the Heir, he will, then, either deny
that the Tenant has tendered him the Homage and reasonable Relief,
or he will admit it. If he confess both the one and the other, he
shall either immediately receive the Tenant’s Homage and reasonable
Relief in Court, or he shall appoint him a fit day for doing it. The
same observation may be made, although he deny that the Tenant has
proffered to him his Homage or Relief, provided he admit the Tenant
to be the Heir. But if in decided terms he denies the Tenant to be
the Heir, then, indeed, may the latter, if out of possession, require
against his Lord an Assise <i><span lang="la">de morte Antecessoris sui</span></i>. Should
the Tenant, however, happen to be in possession, he may hold himself
in it, and patiently await, until it pleases his Lord to accept his
Homage; because, no one is previously bound to answer his Lord as to
the Relief, until the latter has received his Homage for the Fee, on
account of which Homage is due to him. But if the Lord doubts, whether
the person tendering the Homage be the right Heir or not,<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> being
for example unknown to the Lord himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">-188-</span> or even to the Vicinage in
the character of Heir, then the Lord of the Fee may take the Land into
his own hands, and retain it, until the point be fully cleared up, a
course of proceeding, which the King generally adopts with respect to
all his Barons holding of him <i><span lang="la">in Capite</span></i>.</p>

<p>For, upon the death of a Baron holding of him in chief, the King
immediately retains<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> the Barony in his own hands, until the Heir
has given security for the Relief, although the Heir should be of
full age. But Lords, for a reasonable cause, may sometimes postpone
receiving Homage and Relief for their Fees. Suppose, for Example,
another person, than the one who asserts himself to be the Heir, should
claim a right in the Inheritance. During the pendency of this Suit,
Homage ought not to be received, nor a Relief given. Or, if the Lord
think that he himself has a right to hold the Inheritance in his own
Demesne.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">-189-</span> And if in such case he should, by force of the King’s Writ or
that of his Justices, implead the person in possession, the Tenant may
put himself upon the King’s Grand Assise, the form of which proceeding
is explained in the <a href="#Book_II">second Book</a>, unless in some respects there should
be a variation, an Example of which we have in the following Writ for
such purpose——</p>

<h3>CHAP. VIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> after it has been settled between the Lord and the Heir of the
Tenant concerning the giving and receiving of the reasonable Relief,
the latter may exact reasonable Aids from his Homagers.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> This,
however, must be done<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> with moderation, keeping in view the extent
of their Fees, and the circumstances of the Tenants, least they
should be too much oppressed, or lose their Contenement.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> But
nothing certain is fixed, concerning the giving or exacting Aids of
this description, unless that the form we have mentioned should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">-191-</span> be
inviolably observed. There are also other cases, in which a Lord can
exact from his Homagers similar Aids, observing, however, the principle
we have laid down: as if his Son and Heir should be made a Knight, or
if he should marry off his Eldest Daughter.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> But, whether Lords can
exact these Aids to maintain their own Wars, is doubtful. The opinion
that prevails is, that they cannot by right distrain their Tenants
for such purpose, unless so far as the Tenants may feel disposed.
But, with respect to the rendering of reasonable Aids, Lords may of
right, without the King’s precept, or that of his Justices, but by
the Judgment of their own Court, distrain their Tenants by such of
their chattels as may be found within their Fees, or by their Fees,
if necessary; provided the Tenants are dealt with according to the
Judgment of the Court, and consistently with the reasonable Custom of
it. If, therefore, a Lord may thus distrain his Tenants<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> to render<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">-192-</span>
such reasonable Aids, much stronger is the argument in favor of its
being lawful for him to distrain in the same manner for a Relief, as
also for any other service necessarily due to him, in respect of the
Fee. But if a Lord is unable to compel<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> his Tenant to render his
services or Customs, then recourse must be had to the Assistance of the
King, or his Chief Justice, and he shall obtain the following Writ——</p>

a City upon the King’s Street. And, generally speaking, whenever a
Nuisance is committed affecting the King’s Lands, or the King’s High
Way, or a City, the suit concerning it belongs to the King’s Crown.
But Purprestures of this description are enquired after, either in the
King’s Chief Court, or before his Justices sent into the different
parts of the Kingdom<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> for the purpose of making such Inquisitions,
by a Jury of the Place,<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> or Vicinage. And if, by such Jury, a man
be convicted of having made any Purpresture of this kind, he shall
be amerced to the King to the extent of the whole Fee that he holds

convicted of having encroached by building in a City upon the King’s

<h3>CHAP. III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have sufficiently explained the course of proceeding to be adopted,
in case of the absence of either of the parties, or of default, before
the suit is entered upon. We should, however, remark that, it is
not usual for the King’s Court to compel any one by distraining his
Chattels to appear in Court, on account of any suit. In such a Suit,
therefore, any one may by the Judgment of the Court be distrained by
his Fee, or by attaching his Pledges, as is usually done in other
suits. Both parties being present in Court, the Plaintiff may found
his demand on a variety of causes. His Debt may arise either upon
a Lending,<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> or a Sale, or a Borrowing, or a Letting out, or a
Deposit, or from some other just cause inducing a Debt.</p>

<p>A Debt of the first description arises, when one person entrusts
another with any such thing as consists in Number, or Weight, or
Measure.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> When one person so entrusts another, if he should receive
back more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">-200-</span> than he lent, he commits Usury; and, if he die in such
Crime, he shall, by the Law of the Land, be punished as a Usurer, of
which, indeed, we have spoken more fully in the preceding pages.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
But when any thing is entrusted to another, it is, generally, confided
upon the giving of Pledges:<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> sometimes, indeed, upon the putting
things in Pledge: sometimes, under a solemn promise; sometimes upon the
Exposition of a Charter: and at other times upon the conjoined strength
of many of these Securities. When, therefore, any Debt is secured upon
the giving of Pledges alone, if the principal Debtor should be so much
reduced as to be incapable of discharging it, then, recourse must be
had to the Pledges; and they shall be summoned by the following Writ——</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. IV.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> King to the Sheriff, Health. Command <i>N.</i>, that justly and
without delay, he acquit <i>R.</i> of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">-201-</span> Hundred Marks against
<i>N.</i>, for which he became his surety, as he says, and of which he
complains he has not acquitted him. And, unless he does so, summon him,
by good Summoners, &amp;c.”</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. V.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Pledges appear in Court, they will either confess their
Suretyship, or they will deny it. Should they adopt the former course,
they are then bound<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> to satisfy the Creditor, at a convenient time
appointed in Court for such purpose; or they are bound in a legal
manner to prove, that they are discharged from such suretyship by
payment, or by some other lawful means. But, if there are many Pledges,
each of them is answerable for the whole Debt, unless it was otherwise
stipulated when they became Sureties; and they are all to be distrained
to satisfy the Debt.</p>

<p>Hence, if there were many Sureties, and one or more of them prove
incapable of answering the engagement, the burthen of the Debt shall
fall upon the others, either entirely, or to the extent of the
Deficiency. But if, in becoming sureties for a person indebted, the
Pledges assumed the responsibility of certain parts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">-202-</span> only, whatever may
happen as to some of the Pledges, the others shall not be compelled
to answer, except for their own proportion. From this it is evident
that a dispute may sometimes arise between the Creditor and the
Pledges—sometimes between the Pledges themselves, if any one of them
should allege that he had become the surety of the principal Debtor
for a less sum, whilst, on the other hand, it is asserted that he
became so for a greater. For when the Pledges are individually bound
for certain parts, it follows of necessity, that the Creditor himself
must sue the one, who confesses to owe less upon his undertaking than
he ought. But, should some of them become Pledges for the whole, some
for certain parts, then, indeed, it will be requisite, that those who
have become sureties for the whole should sue those who will only
confess themselves indebted in a less sum than they really owe. How
these different points are to be proved, will be seen in the sequel.
The Sureties, having discharged the Debt, may have recourse to the
principal Debtor, should he afterwards acquire sufficient to repay
them; and this by an original Action of Debt, of which we shall
presently speak. It should, however, be observed, that if a Man has
become a Pledge for another’s appearance, and he should, in consequence
of the default of his Principal, happen to be amerced, and in respect
of it pay any sum, he cannot afterwards on this account recover any
thing against him for whom he became Surety.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> Whoever, indeed, has
become a Pledge for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">-203-</span> another’s appearance in any suit that belongs to
the King’s Crown, as, concerning the breaking of the King’s peace,
or otherwise, if he do not produce his Principal, he shall, as a
consequence of his suretyship, be amerced to the King, of the nature of
which we spoke on a former occasion. But the effect of this will be to
liberate him from his suretyship.</p>

<p>Should, however, the Pledges deny in Court their Suretyship, then, if
there were many Pledges, either all of them will deny such suretyship,
or some will admit, and some deny it. But, if some admit, and some deny
it, then, there may be a Suit, as well between the Creditor himself and
the Pledges, as between those Pledges who confess, and those who deny
their engagement, according to what we have previously observed.</p>

<p>But, what shall be the proof required of those, between whom the suit
is to be conducted, is a question? Whether, for example, it should be
made by the Duel, or by any other mode; or whether the Pledges can, by
the oaths of such a number of men as the Court may require, deny their
undertaking? With respect to this point, some persons assert, that the
Creditor himself, by his own oath and that of lawful Witnesses, can
by Law prove it against the Pledges, unless the Pledges will prevent
him from the oath; and this may now be done when the Demandant appears
prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">-204-</span> to take the oath, though formerly it ought to have been done
before the Law was waged.</p>

<p>Thus in such case the Duel may be resorted to.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. VI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A Loan</span><a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> is sometimes made, upon the Credit of a putting in Pledge.
When a Loan of this description takes place, sometimes moveables,
as Chattels, are put in pledge: sometimes immoveables, as Lands and
Tenements, and Rents, whether consisting in Money, or in other things.
When a Compact is made between a Creditor and Debtor, concerning the
putting any thing in pledge, then, whatever be the mode of pledging,
the Debtor upon his receiving the thing lent to him, either immediately
delivers possession of the Pledge to the Creditor, or not. Sometimes
also a thing is pledged for a certain period, sometimes indefinitely.</p>

<p>Again, sometimes, a thing is pledged as a Mortgage, sometimes not. A
pledge is designated by the Term Mortgage,<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> when the fruits and
Rents, which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">-205-</span> received in the interval, in no measure tend to
reduce the demand for which the pledge has been given.</p>

<p>When, therefore, moveables are put in pledge, so that possession be
delivered to the Creditor for a certain period, he is bound to keep
the pledge safely, and neither to use it, nor in any other manner
employ it, so as to render it of less Value. But should it, whilst in
Custody and within the Term, suffer deterioration, by the fault of the
creditor, a Computation shall be made to the extent of the detriment,
and deducted from the Debt. But, if the thing be of such a description
that it necessarily requires some expence and cost, for Example, that
it might be fed or repaired, then the stipulation of the parties on
that subject shall be abided by. In addition—when a thing is pledged
for a definite period, it is either agreed between the Creditor and
Debtor, that if, at the time appointed, the Debtor should not redeem
his pledge, it should then belong to the Creditor so that he might
dispose of it as his own; or no such agreement is entered into between
them. In the former case, the Agreement must be adhered to; in the
latter, the Term being unexpired<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> without the Debtor’s discharging
the Debt, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">-206-</span> Creditor may complain of him, and the Debtor shall be
compelled to appear in Court, and answer by the following Writ.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. VII.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> King to the Sheriff, Health. Command <i>N.</i>, that justly
and without delay, he redeem such a thing which he has pledged to
<i>R.</i>, for a hundred Marks, for a Term which is past, as he says,
and of which he complains that he has not redeemed it; and, unless he
does so, &amp;c.”</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3><a id="BOOK10_CHAP_VIII"></a>CHAP. VIII.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> what manner the Debtor shall be distrained to appear in Court,
whether by the Pledge itself, or by another mode, is doubtful. But
that may be left to the discretion of the Court, as the matter can be
sufficiently expedited whichever mode is resorted to. It is, however,
sometimes requisite that he should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">-207-</span> present in Court, before the
thing in question be adjudged absolutely to the Creditor; since, were
he present, he might alledge some reason, why the thing should not
irrevocably belong to the Creditor. But when the Debtor appear in
Court, he will either confess, that he pledged the thing in question
for the Debt, or he will deny it. If he confess it, as he has in
so doing confessed the Debt, he shall be commanded at a reasonable
period to redeem his pledge; and, unless he should comply, liberty
shall be given to the Creditor, from that time, to treat the pledge
as his own property, and do whatever he chuses with it. Should the
Debtor, however, deny it, he will then either acknowledge that the
thing is his property, but that for some cause it happened to be out
of his possession, and to have got into the hands of the other, as
a Loan, or as being intrusted to him for Custody or from some other
cause of this nature; or he will confess in Court, that the thing is
not his property, which if he should do, liberty shall immediately be
conceded to the Creditor, to dispose of the thing in question, as his
own. But, if he alledge that the thing is his property, but denies
as well the pledge as the Debt; then, the Creditor shall be obliged
to prove against him, that he intrusted the other to the extent of
the present demand, and that the Debtor in return pledged to him the
specific object in dispute. The nature of this proof may be collected
from what we formerly laid down, in treating of Pledges who deny their
suretyship. But, previous to the period fixed for the payment, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">-208-</span>
Debt cannot be demanded; although, if a thing be pledged indefinitely,
and without any period being fixed, the Creditor may, at any time
he chuses, demand the Debt. The Debt being discharged by the person
owing it, the Creditor is bound to restore to him the thing pledged,
without its having suffered any deterioration; nor, if the thing
should by any accident be lost or injured whilst in his Custody, is
the Creditor from that circumstance liberated from the Debtor’s claim;
because he is decidedly bound, either to restore the thing pledged or
to make satisfaction for it, or to lose his Debt. When a Compact is
entered into between a Debtor and Creditor, concerning the pledging
of a particular thing, if the Debtor, after having received the Loan,
should not deliver the pledge,<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> it may be asked, what step should
the Creditor have recourse to in such a case, especially as the same
thing may be pledged to many other Creditors, both previously and
subsequently? Upon this subject, it should be remarked, that the King’s
Court is not in the habit of giving protection to or warranting private
Agreements of this description, concerning the giving or accepting
things in pledge, or others of this kind, made out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">-209-</span> Court, or
even in any other Court than that of the King. If, therefore, such
Compacts are not observed, the King’s Court does not interfere: and
hence it is not bound to answer concerning the right of different
Creditors, as prior or subsequent, or respecting their privileges.
But, when an immoveable thing is put into pledge, and Seisin of it
has been delivered to the Creditor for a definite term, it has either
been agreed between the Creditor and Debtor, that the proceeds and
rents shall in the mean time reduce the Debt, or that they shall in no
measure be so applied. The former Agreement is just and binding: the
other, unjust and dishonest, and is that called a Mortgage, but this is
not prohibited by the King’s Court, although it considers such a pledge
as a species of Usury.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> Hence, if any one die having such pledge,
and this be proved after his death, his property shall be disposed of
no otherwise than as the Effects of a Usurer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">-210-</span></p>

<p>In other respects, the same Rules should be observed, as in pledges of
moveables, concerning which we have already spoken. But, it must be
remarked, that if, after any one has paid his Debt, or has in a proper
manner tendered it, the Creditor should maliciously detain the pledge,
the Debtor upon complaining to the Court shall have the following Writ——</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. IX.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> King to the Sheriff, Health. Command <i>N.</i> that justly and
without delay, he render to <i>R.</i> the whole Lands, or such Lands,
in such a Vill, which he has pledged to him for a Hundred Marks for a
term which is past, as he says, and has received his Money, or which he
has redeemed, as he says; and, unless he does so Summon him by good &amp;c.”</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. X.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> the Creditor’s appearing in Court, being summoned for this
purpose, he will either acknowledge the Land in question, as his
pledge, or he will say, he holds such Land, as his Fee. In the former
case, he ought either to return the pledge, or shew to the Court
some reasonable cause, why he should not be compelled to do so. In
the latter case, it shall, upon the prayer either of the Creditor or
Debtor, be put upon a Recognition of the County, whether the Creditor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">-211-</span>
holds the Land in question, as his Fee, or his Pledge; or whether his
Father, or any other of his Ancestors, was seised of it, as in Fee or
in Pledge, on the day of his death; and, so it may be objected to him
who seeks the Land upon the seisin of his Father.</p>

<p>Thus the Recognition upon this subject may be infinitely varied, to
correspond with the Claim and the Defence. But, if the Recognition be
not prayed by either party, the Plea may proceed in Court upon the
Right.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. XI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the Creditor lose his Seisin, either by means of the Debtor, or any
other person, he cannot recover it through the assistance of the Court;
not even by a Recognition of Novel Disseisin.</p>

<p>For if he was unjustly and without a judgment disseised of his pledge,
by any other person than the Debtor himself, the Debtor may have an
Assise of Novel Disseisin. If, however, the Creditor was disseised by
the Debtor himself, the Court will not assist him against the Debtor,
in recovering his pledge, or in giving him a Re-entry, unless through
the Debtor himself; for the Creditor should resort to an original
Plea of Debt, in order that the Debtor may be compelled to render him
satisfaction for his Debt. In such case, the Debtor shall be summoned
by the foregoing Writ of first summons.</p>

<hr class="short">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">-212-</span></p>


<h3>CHAP. XII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> the Debtor’s appearing on the day appointed in Court, if the
Creditor has neither Pledge, nor Sureties, nor any other proof, unless
the mere faith of the other, this will not be received as any proof in
the King’s Court.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Yet, he may proceed for the breach or violation
of faith in the Court Christian. But, though the Ecclesiastical Judge
can hold cognizance of such crime, and either impose penance on the
convicted party, or enjoin him to make satisfaction, yet, with respect
to Pleas concerning the Debts of the Laity, or affecting Tenements, the
Court Christian cannot by a Law of the Realm hold or decide them, under
the pretence of the party having pledged his promise.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> The Creditor
ought, therefore, to adduce other proof, if the Debtor deny the Debt in
question.</p>

<p>For if he admit it, then, he is bound to discharge it, in manner
similar to that we have already explained, in speaking of Pledges,
confessing their suretyship.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Should he, however, deny it, the
Creditor may prove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">-213-</span> his demand, either by a proper Witness, or by
the Duel, or by a Charter. When, therefore, any one offer in Court,
as proof of the Debt, the Charter of his Adversary, or his Ancestor,
the Defendant will either admit such Charter, or deny it. In the
latter case, he may deny or controvert it in two ways: thus, he may
acknowledge in Court the seal to be his own, but deny that the Charter
was made either by him, or with his consent, or that of his Ancestor;
or he may absolutely deny, both the Seal and the Charter. In the first
case, when he has publicly in court acknowledged the Seal to be his
own, he is bound to warrant the terms of the Charter, and, in all
respects, to observe the compact expressed in the Charter as contained
in it, without question, and to impute it to his own indiscretion,
if he incur any loss by negligently preserving his own Seal. But in
the latter case, the Charter may be proved in Court by the Duel by
any proper Witness, especially if his name be inserted in the Charter
itself. There is another mode by which the Credit of a Charter is
accustomed to be established in Court, namely, by some certain and
unquestionable signs. As, for Example, by other Charters, impressed
with the same Seal, and concerning which it is clear, that they are
the Charters of the party, who denies the present Charter, because he
has openly warranted them in Court. If in such case the impressions
coincide in every respect with one another, so that there is no
suspicion of any difference between the Seals, it is usual to consider
the fact as proved; and, whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">-214-</span> by this, or by any other legal mode,
the party should be overcome, he shall lose his suit on the occasion,
whether it be a Plea of Debt, or concerning Land, or any other thing
whatever; and he shall, in addition, be amerced to the King. For, it
is a general Rule, that whenever a person has said any thing in Court
or in a Plea which he afterwards denies, or of which he has neither
suit, nor Warrantor, nor sufficient proof,<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> or has been distrained
to assert the contrary, or to deny it by sufficient proof, he shall
be amerced to the King. But, if the person, against whom the Charter
is produced to prove a certain Debt, acknowledge it from the first,
then he shall be compelled to satisfy the Creditor, according to the
tenor of the Charter. When any thing is lent on the joint strength of
many of the proceeding securities, then, from the moment the Debtor
makes default, he is liable to be distrained by all the securities
being put in force against him at the same time. It is on this account,
therefore, that many securities are taken, that in case of the
inability of the Debtor, the Creditor may more readily be satisfied,
than if there exist but one security only.</p>

price is settled between the contracting parties; provided possession
of the thing purchased and sold be delivered,<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> or that the price,
either wholly, or in part, be paid, or, at least, that Earnest<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> be
given and received.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">-217-</span></p>

<p>But, in the two former cases, neither of the Contracting parties can
by any means at his own option recede from the Agreement, unless for
some just and reasonable cause; as, if the terms of the contract were,
that either of the parties may with impunity retract within a certain
period; then, indeed, either party may within the period prescribed
avail himself of the terms of the Contract and recede, without being
liable to any penalty: since it is, generally speaking, unquestionable
that, <i><span lang="la">Conventio legem vincit</span></i>.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> Besides, if the Vendor sold
the thing to the Purchaser as being sound and without fault,<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>
and the Purchaser can afterwards satisfactorily shew, that the thing
at the time of the contract was not sound, but faulty, then, indeed,
the Vendor shall be compelled to take back his property. But it is
sufficient, if the thing was in a proper state, at the time of the
Contract, whatever may afterwards happen to it. But I doubt, as to the
period within which this should be proved, or complaint made concerning
it, especially where there is no special Agreement. Where, however,
Earnest only has been given, if the Purchaser would recede from the
Contract, he may do so, with the loss of the Earnest. But if, in such
case, the Vendor would retract, it is a question whether he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">-218-</span> can do
so without incurring a penalty.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> It does not seem that he can;
because he would then be in a better situation than the Purchaser.
But, if it cannot be done with impunity, what punishment shall such
conduct incur?<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> The risk of the thing sold and purchased generally
belongs to the person who has possession of it,<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> unless it has been
differently arranged.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. XV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Vendor and his Heirs are bound to warrant the thing sold to the
purchaser and his Heirs, if the thing be an immoveable; and hence, the
Purchaser<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> and his Heirs may be sued in the manner we have formerly
explained, in treating of Warranties.</p>

<p>If any person sue the Purchaser with respect to a moveable, on the
ground that the thing in question was first sold or given to him, or
from any other just cause was acquired, unconnected with the imputation
of Felony, the same rule may be laid down as that we have mentioned
concerning immoveables. But if, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">-219-</span> an imputation of Theft,<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
the Purchaser is sued for the thing, he is bound in the clearest
manner to remove from himself every such an imputation, or to call a
Warrantor.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> If, therefore, he adopt the latter course, he will name
either a certain Warrantor, or an uncertain one. If he call a certain
Warrantor to Court, alleging that he desires to have him to Warrant at
a reasonable period, then a day is to be given him in Court for that
purpose.</p>

<p>And, if the person called to Warrant appear on that day, and warrant
in Court, both the sale and the thing sold to the Purchaser, then, the
latter shall be entirely discharged, and that so effectually, that
he shall not afterwards sustain any loss. But, if he should fail in
entering into the Warranty, then, the Plea shall proceed between the
Purchaser and his Warrantor; and thus may it come to the Duel. But, it
may be asked, can the Warrantor call another Warrantor into Court? If
that be permitted, at what Warrantor must it stop?<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> It should be
added, that when any one has so named<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">-220-</span> a Warrantor of a thing which is
sued for as stolen, the Warrantor is usually attached by virtue of the
following Writ, directed to the Sheriff:—</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. XVI.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> King to the Sheriff, Health. I command you, that justly and
without delay, you cause <i>N.</i> to be attached, by safe and secure
Pledges, that he be before me, or my Justices, on a certain day, to
warrant <i>R.</i> such a thing which <i>H.</i> claims against <i>R.</i>
as stolen, and of which the aforesaid <i>R.</i> has drawn him to
warrant in my Court; or to shew wherefore, he ought not to warrant to
him. And have there the Summoners and this Writ, &amp;c.”</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. XVII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, if the Purchaser should call an uncertain Warrantor, in such case,
if he have sufficient proof of its being a lawful purchase, that shall
discharge him from the Felony.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Yet it shall not protect him from
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">-221-</span> loss, I mean, of the thing in question. But, if upon this point he
has not a sufficient suit, he is in danger.</p>

<p>Debts arising either from a purchase or a borrowing are usually
substantiated by the general mode of proof in Court; in other words,
either by a Writing, or by Duel.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. XVIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A debt</span> sometimes arises from a Letting out and a Hiring:<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> as
when any one lets out a thing to another for a certain period, in
consideration of receiving a certain reward. In such case, the former
is bound to concede the use of the thing, and the latter to pay the
price. But, it should be observed, upon the expiration of the term
stipulated, the former may lawfully and of his own authority resume
possession of his property.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> But, if the person engaging to hire
the thing should not pay the price at the appointed time, it may
be asked, whether the other party can in such case forcibly resume
possession by his own authority?</p>

<p>But we briefly pass over the foregoing Contracts, arising as they do
from the consent of private individuals;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">-222-</span> because, as it has already
been observed, the King’s Court does not usually take cognizance of
them; nor, indeed, with such Contracts, as may be considered in the
light of private Agreements, does the King’s Court intermeddle.</p>

<h3>CHAP. I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Suits discussed in the former part of this Treatise concern the
Right and Propriety of the thing, which a person may prosecute,
as indeed, some other Civil Pleas, as well by himself, as by an
Attorney<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> put in his place to gain or lose. But the person, who
thus puts another in his place, ought to be present<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> in Court.</p>

<p>It is usually done in the presence of the King’s Justices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">-224-</span> of the
Common Pleas. But on no account, otherwise than as having been
appointed by his Principal, when present in Court, ought any one to be
received as an Attorney.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> It is not requisite, that the adverse
party should on that account be present in Court;<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> nor, indeed,
the person who is so put in the place of the other, if he be known to
the Court. One person alone may be put in the place of another; or two
or more, either collectively or separately; so that, if one of them is
unable to attend, the other or others may follow up the Plea. Through
the medium of such an Attorney, a Plea may be commenced in Court, and
determined, whether by Judgment, or final Concord; and that, as fully
and effectually, as by the Principal himself.</p>

<p>But, it should be understood that, it will not suffice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">-225-</span> for any one to
constitute another his Bailiff<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> or Steward<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> for the managing
his Lands and affairs, even if it be made to appear to the Court, in
order that he should be received in Court in any Suit in the place of
his Principal.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> But, it is necessary that, a special authority
should be delegated for this purpose; and that the Attorney should, in
the manner before described, be put in his place, expressly in that
particular Action, to lose or gain for him.</p>

<p>It should also be observed, that any one may in the King’s Court put
another in his place, to gain or lose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">-226-</span> for him, even in a suit that
he has in another Court; and it shall be commanded, that the Attorney
shall be received in such Court in the place of his Principal, by the
following Writ——</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. II.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> King to the Sheriff, or to any other presiding in his Court,
Health. Know that <i>N.</i> hath before me, or my Justices, put
<i>R.</i> in his place to gain or lose for him, in the Plea which is
between him and <i>R.</i><a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> concerning one ploughland or concerning
any other thing, (naming it) and, therefore, I command you, that you
receive the aforesaid <i>R.</i> in the place of the said <i>N.</i>, in
such Plea, to gain or lose. Witness, &amp;c.”</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> any one, therefore, according to the form, before mentioned, is
put in the place of another in any suit, it may be asked, whether
Essoins shall hold with reference to the person of the Attorney only,
or the person of his Principal only, or with regard to both of them?
And, indeed, the Essoins of the Attorney himself only shall in such
case be allowed, until his appointment is revoked.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> When any one,
so put in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">-227-</span> place of another in Court, answer to the suit, and does
that which appertains to him, it may be asked, whether his Principal
can at his pleasure remove him, and substitute another Attorney,
especially if any great degree of Enmity should subsequently arise
between them?</p>

<p>That the Principal himself, indeed, may follow up the Suit, the
Attorney being removed, is unquestionable; because every Man is
understood to put another in his place, under the tacit condition,
that he himself cannot be present. The prevailing practice permits a
Principal to remove such Attorney, in any part of the Suit, and also
to replace him by substituting another in Court, in the manner before
mentioned. A Father may thus substitute his Son, and vice versa: one
stranger may also substitute another; and a Wife her husband. When
a Husband, put in the place of his Wife in a suit concerning her
marriage-hood or Dower, should lose any part of the property of his
Wife, or should, by a Judgment or a Concord, remit any right of the
Wife, whether, it may be asked, can the Wife herself again agitate the
question, or whether is she absolutely bound, after the death of her
Husband, to abide by his Act? It does not seem that the woman in such a
case ought, by the Act of her Husband, to lose any part of her right;
because, whilst in the power of her Husband, she can in no measure
oppose or controvert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">-228-</span> his Will, and, therefore, she could not, contrary
to his pleasure, look into her rights.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> But, on the other hand, it
may be contended, that those Acts which are transacted in the King’s
Court, ought to be held settled and unalterable.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. IV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Principal is to be distrained to abide by what has been done by his
Attorney, whether it be so done by Judgment or by Concord. But what
must be done, if the Principal is incompetent to pay, and has nothing
whereby he can be distrained, although the Attorney has? The Attorney,
indeed, must not be distrained.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3><a id="BOOK11_CHAP_V"></a>CHAP. V.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> principle that we have just laid down, that no one, unless present
in Court, can effectually put another in his place, seems contrary to
what is contained in the <a href="#Book_I">first Book</a>, upon the doctrine of Essoins.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>
For, it is there stated, that if any one should, after his third
Essoin, send an Attorney, whoever he happen to be, with Letters, he
should be received in Court. But this happens by force of the Judgment.
A different Rule<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">-229-</span> prevails where, urged by an order of the Court, or
by a Distress, a person prays to put another in his place in a Suit,
to gain or lose for him. It should also be observed, that Abbots
and Priors of Canons Regular are received in Court, upon their own
authority, without even the Letters of their Convents.</p>

<p>Other Priors, whether of Canons or Monks, if Cellarii<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> even though
Aliens, are by no means to be admitted in Court, without the Letters
of their Abbot or Grand Prior.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> The Master of the Knight-Templars
and the Chief Prior of the Hospital of Jerusalem<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> are also received
upon their own authority; but none of their Orders of a Rank inferior
to them are in the habit of being received. When one or more have been
substituted in Court to conduct a Suit for another, in the manner
before mentioned, whether the one can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">-230-</span> delegate his authority to
another, or whether one of the two can nominate the other, or a third,
in his place, or in that of his Principal, to gain or lose for him in
that Suit, are points at least questionable.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<h3><a id="BOOK12_CHAP_VII"></a>CHAP. VII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> Courts are proved to have failed in doing Justice in this manner.
Upon the Demandant’s complaining to the Sheriff in the County Courts,
and producing the King’s Writ, the Sheriff shall send one of his
Officers to the Lord’s Court on the day appointed the parties by the
Lord of such Court, in order that the Officer, in the presence of four
or a greater number of the lawful Knights of the County, who by the
Sheriff’s command shall attend there, might hear and see the proof of
the Demandant, namely, that such Court had failed to do him Justice in
his Suit. That the fact is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">-235-</span> so, the Demandant shall prove, by his own
oath and that of two others, who have heard and known the fact, and
shall swear with him.</p>

<p>Under such solemnity, then, Pleas are generally removed from these
Courts into the County Court, and are there again discussed and finally
terminated, without any contradiction or recovery on the part of such
Courts, or the Lords of them, or their Heirs, so far as concerns the
Plea in question. But if, previously to such Court being proved in the
manner we have stated to have failed in doing right, any Plea should
be drawn from it to the superior Court, the Lord of the inferior Court
may take advantage of such circumstance and on the day appointed for
the Trial of the cause reclaim his Jurisdiction; because his Court has
not been proved to have failed in doing Justice; and thus he shall
be adjudged to recover it, unless it be there proved, that his Court
failed in doing Justice, as before remarked. It should, however, be
observed, that if a Plea has been so drawn to the King’s Chief Court,
it will be in vain for the Lord to reclaim it on the day of trial,
unless, on the third day preceding, he had claimed it, in the presence
of lawful Men.</p>

<p>But if no day be given to the Demandant on which to make his Complaint,
and he has experienced a delay, it will suffice for him to falsify the
Court, under the form before mentioned, in whatever part of the Fee he
may chuse, if the Lord has no residence<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">-236-</span> the Fee, it being
lawful for him, as Lord, to hold his Court there, and put a day to the
Demandant, in whatever part of his Fee he chuses. But he cannot legally
do so out of his Fee.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<h3>CHAP. VIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the Writ to be obtained ought to be directed to him only, of whom
the Demandant claims to hold, and not to another, nor even to the Chief
Lord. But, it may here be asked, what will be the consequence, if the
Demandant claim to hold of one Lord, and the Tenant of another? In
such a case, since the Lord to whom the Writ is directed cannot take
cognizance of the suit, and unjustly and without a Judgment disseise
another Lord of the right of holding a Court, of which he is understood
to be seised, recourse must necessarily be had to the County Court,
where the Suit shall proceed; or, in the Chief Court, so that both the
Lords ought to be present there by Summons, in order that the thing
should be discussed before them, in the manner we formerly mentioned

<h3>CHAP. XXIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> respect to the manner or the right of commencing or terminating
these Pleas, or others in different County Courts, I forbear to speak,
as well on account of the different Customs which prevail in different
Counties, each observing its own peculiar Customs, as of the brevity of
my proposed object, no Pleas coming within the scope of it, but those
which are usually discussed in the King’s Chief Court.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. XXIV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> should also be observed, that in a Writ of Right sometimes less is
comprised than is inserted in the Count in Court, as well respecting
the Appurtenances as other things; but sometimes more is included.
Sometimes there is an Error in the Writ, as to the name inserted in
it, sometimes concerning the quantity of Services. When, indeed, less
is contained in the Writ than in the Count, the party cannot demand
more by force of the Writ, than is comprised in it. But when more is
contained in the Writ, than in the Count, the Excess which is comprised
in it may be remitted, and the residue may be claimed by virtue of
the Writ. But, if there be an Error in the name, then, by strictness
of Law, another Writ must be sued out. But when the Error concern the
quantity of service, the Writ, in strictness of Law, is also lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">-245-</span></p>

<p>Yet, as it sometimes happens, that a Tenement is demanded by less
service than is due in respect of it, or than has been accustomed to be
rendered to the Lord, it may be asked, whether the Lord is bound by the
Writ to do right to the detriment of his own service? He is, indeed,
bound; but should the Demandant happen to prevail, the Lord after
Eviction may recover against the party evicting him.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. XXV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> should also be added, that, according to the Customs of the Realm,
no one is bound to answer in his Lord’s Court, concerning his Freehold
Tenement, without the King’s precept, or that of his Chief Justice; I
mean, if the Fee in question be a lay one.</p>

<p>But, if the Plea should be between two Clerks, concerning a Tenement
held in Frankalmoigne of an Ecclesiastical Fee, or if the Tenant, a
Clerk, hold an Ecclesiastical Fee in Frankalmoigne, whoever may happen
to be the Demandant, the Plea concerning the Right ought to be in
the Ecclesiastical Court, unless a Recognition should be demanded,
whether the Fee in question be Ecclesiastical or lay, of which we shall
presently speak. For then such Recognition, as, indeed, certain others,
must be held in the King’s Court.</p>

<h3>CHAP. I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> general course of Proceedings, as they more usually occur in Court
upon the foregoing Writs of Right, having been so far treated of,
it now remains to speak concerning the steps commonly resorted to,
where Seisin alone is in question. As these questions are, under the
beneficial provisions of a Law of the Realm, which is termed an Assise,
usually and for the most part decided by a Recognition, our subject
leads us to treat of the different kinds of Recognitions.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is one species of Recognition which is called <i><span lang="fr">Mort
d’Auncestor</span></i><a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>—another <i><span lang="la">de ultimis presentationibus</span></i>
of Parsons to their churches—another, whether a Tenement be an
Ecclesiastical Fee or Lay Fee—another, whether any one was seised of a
Freehold on the day of his death, as of fee or as of pledge—another,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">-247-</span>
whether any one be under age or of full age—another whether any one
died seised of a certain Freehold as of fee, or as of ward—another,
whether any one presented the last Parson to a Church, by virtue of the
Fee that he held in his Demesne, or by virtue of a Wardship.—And others
of a similar description, which, as they frequently arise in Court when
the parties are present, are, with their consent and the advice of the
Court, directed, in order to determine the point in controversy. But
there is another Recognition which is called <i>Novel Disseisin</i>.
When, therefore, any one dies seised of a Freehold in his Demesne as of
Fee, the Heir may justly claim the seisin of his Ancestor; and, if he
be of full age, he shall have the following Writ——</p>

<h3>CHAP. III.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> King to the Sheriff, Health.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> If <i>G.</i>, the son of

day, prepared on their oath to return, if <i>T.</i> the father of
the aforesaid <i>G.</i> was seised in his Demesne as of Fee, of one
Yardland, in that Vill, on the day of his death—if he died after my
first Coronation,<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> and if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">-248-</span> the said <i>G.</i> be his nearer Heir.
And, in the mean time, let them view the Land and cause their names to
be imbreviated; and summon, by good Summoners, <i>R.</i> who holds that
Land, that he be then there to hear such Recognition; and have there
the Summoners &amp;c. Witness &amp;c.” But, if the Ancestor was seised in the
manner before mentioned, and had begun a Voyage, then, the Writ will be

day, prepared upon their oaths to return, if <i>T.</i> the father of
the aforesaid <i>G.</i> was seised in his Demesne as of Fee of one
Yardland, in such a Vill, the day on which he began his Journey to
Jerusalem, or to St. Jago, in which Journey he died.——And, if he began
his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">-249-</span> Journey since my first Coronation, and if the aforesaid <i>G.</i>
be his nearer Heir. And, in the mean time &amp;c.” as before. But, if the
Heir be within age, then the Writ will be as follows——</p>

<h3>CHAP. V.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> King to the Sheriff, Health. Summon by good Summoners, &amp;c.” in

<i>T.</i> shall make you secure of prosecuting his claim.”<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p>Also this clause in the body of the Writ is omitted, “if <i>T.</i> the
Father of the aforesaid <i>G.</i> died after my first Coronation.” But,
if he assumed the habit of Religion, then the Writ, in conformity to
this circumstance, will be varied in the following manner——</p>

<h3>CHAP. VI.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> King to the Sheriff, Health. If <i>G.</i> the Son of <i>T.</i>

present Writ there must be inserted in the Body of it, “prepared upon
their oath to return if <i>T.</i> the father of the aforesaid <i>G.</i>
was seised in his Demesne as of Fee, of so much Land in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">-250-</span> such a Vill,
the day on which he assumed the habit of Religion; and, if he assumed
such habit after my first Coronation; and, if the aforesaid <i>G.</i>
be his nearer Heir; and, in the mean time, that they view the Land &amp;c.”
as before.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. VII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Writ of <i><span lang="fr">Mort d’Auncestor</span></i><a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> having been received by the
Sheriff, and security given by the Demandant in the County Court to
prosecute his claim, the Proceeding in this manner comes to an Assise.
In the first place, twelve free and lawful Men of the Neighbourhood
are to be elected, according to the form expressed in the Writ, both
parties being present, as well the Demandant, as the Tenant, or the
latter being absent, provided he has been summoned once, at least,
to be present at the Election. He is, indeed, to be once summoned in
order that he may be present, and hear who are elected to make such
Recognition. Some of them he may for a reasonable cause object to, if
he is so inclined, and they shall be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">-251-</span> excluded from the Recognition. If
he should not appear at the first Summons, regularly proved in Court,
he shall not be awaited any longer; but, though he be absent, the
twelve Jurors shall be elected, and then sent by the Sheriff to take a
View of the Land or other Tenement in question. Yet the Tenant shall
have one Summons on this account. The Sheriff shall cause the names of
the twelve persons elected to be imbreviated. Having done this, the
Sheriff shall cause the Tenant to be summoned to appear on the day
appointed by the King’s Writ, or that of his Justices, before the King,
or his Justices, to hear the Recognition.</p>

<p>But, if the Demandant be of full age, the Tenant may essoin himself on
the first and second day,<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> but on the third day he cannot do so,
since the Recognition shall be then taken, whether the Tenant appear or
not; because in no Recognition, where Seisin alone be in question, are
more than two Essoins allowed.</p>

<p>But, in a Recognition of Novel Disseisin, no Essoin is permitted. On
the third day, therefore, whether the Tenant appear or not, the Assise
must be taken, as we have observed; and, if the Jurors should decide
for the Demandant, Seisin shall be adjudged him, and the Sheriff shall
be directed to put him into Seisin, by the following Writ——</p>

<hr class="short">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">-252-</span></p>


<h3>CHAP. VIII.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> King to the Sheriff, Health. Know, that <i>N.</i> has, in
my Court, recovered Seisin of so much Land, in such a Vill, by
a Recognition of <i><span lang="fr">Mort d’Auncestor</span></i> against <i>R.</i> and,
therefore, I command you, that you cause him to have the Seisin without
delay—Witness &amp;c.”</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. IX.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, together with the Seisin, the successful party shall recover the
possession of all the chattels and other things found in the Fee, at
the time of delivering Seisin. But, after the Seisin has been fully
recovered, the party who has lost it may sue concerning the Right, by
means of a Writ of Right. Yet it may be questioned, to what time this
is to be restricted, after restitution has been fully made.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. X.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, if the decision be in favor of the absent Tenant, the Seisin shall
then remain to him, without his Adversary being able to recover it.
But such Seisin shall be no bar to a Suit concerning the Right. Nor
shall a Plea of Right concerning any Tenement, prevent a Recognition
for recovering the Seisin of a person’s Ancestor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">-253-</span> in the same Tenement,
previously to the waging of the Duel. But, how then shall his contempt
of Court be punished?</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. XI.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Both</span> Parties being present in Court, it is usual to inquire of the
Tenant whether he can shew any reason, why the Assise should not
proceed? And, here it should be observed, that a person of full
age sometimes demands a Recognition of this kind<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> against a
Minor—sometimes a Minor demands it against one of full age—sometimes a
Minor against a Minor—sometimes one of full age against another of that
description.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> Generally speaking, the Assise shall not proceed, if
the Tenant admits in Court, that the Ancestor, on the strength of whose
Seisin the Demandant founds his claim, was seised on the day of his
death in his Demesne as of Fee, with the other circumstances expressed
in the Writ.</p>

<p>But, if the Seisin only be conceded, the other circumstances not being
admitted, then, the Assise shall proceed upon the circumstance or
circumstances not conceded. An Assise of this kind is accustomed to
cease for many causes—if, for example, it should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">-254-</span> alleged by the
Tenant, that the Demandant was seised after the death of his Father,
or any one of his Ancestors, whether the Ancestor was seised or not,
on the day of his death; and, whilst the Demandant was in such Seisin,
that he had done, with respect to himself, some such act as debarred
him of subsequently resorting to the Assise—as if he had sold, given,
or quitted claim, or, by any other lawful means, had disposed of the
Land in question to the Tenant.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>Should such a defence be set up, recourse may be had to the Duel, or
to any other usual mode of proof, consistent with the practice of
the Court, where the Right to any property is in question. The same
observation applies, should it be alleged by his Adversary, that the
Demandant had, on a former occasion, impleaded him, when a Fine was
made between them in the King’s Court; or that the Land belonged to
the Tenant by the decision of the Duel, in whatever Court it may
have been waged; or by a Judgment, or by quit-claim.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> Villenage,
also, if it be in Court objected and proved against the Demandant,
takes away the Assise.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> An exception of Bastardy has the same
effect.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> The King’s Charter, also, in which the Land, the Seisin
of which is demanded by the Assise, is specifically named or confirmed
to the Tenant, as, indeed, the conjunction of more Heirs than one, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">-255-</span>
Females, for example, in a Military Fee, or of Males or Females in free
socage Tenure.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>Again—if it be conceded, that the Ancestor upon whose Seisin the
Demandant founds his claim, had a certain degree of Seisin, namely—one
derived through the Tenant himself or his Ancestor, as from a Pledge,
a Loan or any other cause of this nature, the Assise shall not go
forward, but recourse must be had to another mode of proceeding.</p>

<p>Consanguinity, also, takes away the Assise; namely, if the Demandant
and Tenant should have sprung from the same stock from which the
Inheritance, the Seisin of which is in question, has descended, and
such fact has been objected and proved in Court.<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> Another cause
has been mentioned in treating of Marriage-hood, when the Eldest Son
has given a certain part of his Lands to his Younger Brother, who
dies without leaving any Heir of his Body.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> In this case, as in
others of a similar description, the Assise we are now treating of
shall cease, since the same person cannot be both Heir and Lord of an
Estate.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> If, also, the Demandant be convicted, or, indeed, confess,
that he was formerly in Arms against the King, the Assise which he so
demands in Court shall from such circumstance cease.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> By reason,
also, of Burgage Tenure, the Assise does not usually proceed. This is
in compliance with a particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">-256-</span> Law of the Realm,<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> having for
its object greater utility. But, if no exception be taken in Court,
on account of which the Assise ought to cease, the Recognition shall
proceed; and, in the presence of both parties, the Seisin shall, on the
oaths of the twelve Jurors, and according to their verdict, be adjudged
to the one or the other, in the manner described in a former part of
this Book.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. XII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, when a Minor prays an Assise of the kind we are treating of
against one of full age, then, indeed, the latter shall not be
allowed any Essoin against the former, because, on the first day,
the Recognition shall proceed, whether the Tenant appear, or absent
himself. And this upon a general principle.</p>

<p>For, whenever it happens, that the Tenant, if present in Court, cannot
allege any cause why such Assise ought not to proceed, the Recognition
ought by right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">-257-</span> to proceed, without awaiting the appearance of the
adverse party. But, if the Tenant were present, he could not, as we
observed, allege that the Minor had done any thing on account of
which the Assise should cease; and, therefore, the Recognition shall
unquestionably proceed, whether the Tenant, being of full age, appear
or not, according to the form before mentioned; and thus, restitution
having been made to the Minor through the Recognition, the full age of
the Minor shall be awaited, if it be intended to sue him concerning the
Right. But when one Minor sues another, the Recognition shall proceed
in the same manner, and without any variation, as it usually does
between a Minor and one of full age.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3><a id="BOOK13_CHAP_XIII"></a>CHAP. XIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, when a person of full age proceeds against a Minor, the latter,
indeed, may avail himself of an Essoin against his Adversary, in the
usual manner. When he appears, he may pray a delay, on account of
his Age, and that the Recognition may not be taken, until he is of
full age; and, thus, on account of Age, the Recognition of <i><span lang="fr">Mort
d’Auncestor</span></i> usually stands over. But here we should observe, upon
the necessity which exists, in order that such Assise should stand
over on account of his age, that the Minor should allege himself to
be in Seisin of the Tenement in question, and, therefore, that the
Recognition ought not to proceed, before he has attained his full age:
nor should he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">-258-</span> omit, that his Father or some other Ancestor was seised
on the day of his death; since, neither a Recognition against a Minor,
nor even a suit concerning the propriety, shall cease, by reason of the
Seisin of a Tenement which any Minor has himself acquired and retains
only by his own right. But, if it be replied to a Minor, that his
Ancestor died seised of the Tenement, the Seisin of which is sought by
the Recognition, not as of Fee, but as of Ward, then, indeed, although
the principal Recognition ought to cease, on account of the Minor’s
age, yet another Recognition shall proceed upon the point, whether the
Minor’s Ancestor was seised as of Fee or of Ward, on the day of his
death; and the Assise shall be summoned, by the following Writ.</p>

let them view that Land; and cause their names to be imbreviated. And
summon, by good Summoners,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">-259-</span> the aforesaid <i>N.</i> who holds such
Land, that he be then there to hear the Recognition. And have &amp;c.”</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3><a id="BOOK13_CHAP_XV"></a>CHAP. XV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, it should be observed, that if a day has been given for this
purpose to both parties, when present in Court, then, the Tenant ought
not to be summoned. But thereupon, a Recognition shall proceed to be
taken on the oaths of twelve Jurors, and, according to their Verdict,
shall it be declared, what Seisin the Minor’s Ancestor had, on the day
of his death, in the Tenement in question; and, if it should be proved,
that the Ancestor of the Minor had no Seisin on the day of his death,
unless as of Ward, then, the Demandant shall recover Seisin against the
Minor. But, it may be questioned, whether this alone be sufficient to
enable him to recover Seisin.</p>

<p>It does not appear to be so; because this by no means proves, that the
Demandant’s Ancestor was seised in his Demesne as of Fee, on the day
of his death; nor even that the Demandant be his nearer Heir. But,
on the contrary, it may be said, that this being proved, the Minor
has consequently no right afterwards to retain the Seisin. But if
this assertion be correct, to whom is the possession to be restored?
whether, in such a case, must recourse be had to the principal
Recognition? If, however, it be proved by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">-260-</span> the oaths of the twelve
Jurors, that the Minor’s Ancestor was seised on the day of his death,
as of Fee, then, the Seisin shall continue to the Minor without
disturbance, until he arrives at his full age.</p>

<p>But, in such a case, can his Adversary or his Heirs on any future
occasion be again heard? He may at least with respect to the Propriety
of that Tenement, as against the Minor, when he has attained his full
age, or against his Heirs. In addition, the Assise should proceed
against a Minor in that one case only, which we observed, in treating
concerning Heirs within age.<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> Upon the Assise proceeding against a
Minor, if the Seisin should be awarded to continue with him, he shall
not answer concerning the Right, until he has attained his full age.
For, it is a general principle, that a Minor is not obliged to answer
to any suit by which he may possibly be deprived of his Inheritance,
or by which he can lose life or member, until he attain his full age.
Yet, in certain other cases, he is bound, as, for example, respecting
his paternal Debts, or his own, and in case of a Novel Disseisin.
Should, however, the Seisin be adjudged against the Minor, in favor
of the Demandant, restitution shall be made to him in the form before
mentioned, nor shall he answer to the Minor upon the question of Right,
until such Minor has attained his full age, as the latter would not be
bound to answer the Demandant. The reason is of general force: because,
such transactions, as take place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">-261-</span> with Minors, in Pleas of this
description, ought not to be held firm and unalterable.</p>

<p>But if, on a Minor alleging himself intitled to the privilege of his
age, it should in Court be objected, that he is of full age, this is
usually ascertained by a Recognition of eight free and lawful Men, who
are to be summoned for such purpose, by the following Writ——</p>

to effect such object, the Tenant may admit, that the Ancestor of the

not usually done in Recognitions, they necessarily preclude a party
from casting a third Essoin. The Recognition we are now treating
of proceeds in the manner we have described, when discussing other
Recognitions. Yet, should it be observed, that if, by the Recognition,
a Tenement be proved to be an Ecclesiastical Fee, it cannot afterwards

as pledged, either by himself, or one of his Ancestors, if the Tenant
does not acknowledge the Tenement in question to be a pledge, but

said <i>R.</i> or by <i>H.</i>, his Ancestor.” Or thus—“whether that

<p>The Warrantor shall be afterwards summoned,<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> and the Plea proceed
between him and the person who has, on this occasion, nominated him as
Warrantor.</p>

<p>Yet, should it be observed, that the unsuccessful party, whether the
Appellor or the appealed,<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> shall in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">-276-</span> every instance be amerced to
the King, on account of the violent Disseisin. In addition, if the
Appellor should not keep his day, then, also, his Pledges are to be
amerced to the King. The same Rule prevails, with respect to the person
of the other party, should he absent himself at the appointed day. The
Penalty inflicted by this Constitution is merely an Amercement to the
King.</p>

<p>But, in this Recognition, the party who has proved the Novel Disseisin,
may obtain, that the Sheriff should be directed to deliver him the
Chattels and the Fruits, which have, by the authority of the King’s
Writ, or that of his Justices, been in the mean time seised.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> In
no other Recognition does the Judgment of the Court usually make any
mention concerning the Chattels or Fruits; and, unless the Sheriff has
taken steps to satisfy him out of the Chattels or Fruits, then, the
party who complains of it, shall obtain the following Writ——</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3><a id="BOOK14_CHAP_I"></a>CHAP. I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus far treated of those Civil Pleas which are discussed in
Court, it remains for us to speak concerning Criminal Pleas. When,
therefore, any one is charged with the King’s death, or with having
promoted a sedition in the Realm or Army,<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> either a certain Accuser
appears, or not. If no certain Accuser should appear, but the public
voice alone accuses him,<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">-279-</span> then, from the first, the accused shall
be safely attached, either by proper Pledges, or imprisonment.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>
The truth of the fact shall, then, be inquired into, by means of many
and various inquisitions and interrogations, made in the presence of
the Justices, and that, by taking into consideration the probable
circumstances of the facts, and weighing each conjecture that tends
in favor of the accused, or makes against him; because he must purge
himself by the Ordeal,<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> or entirely absolve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">-280-</span> himself from the
Crime imputed to him. But if on the trial by the Ordeal, a person is
convicted of a Capital Crime, then the Judgment is of life and members
which are at the King’s mercy,<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> as in other Pleas concerning Felony.</p>

<p>Should, however, a certain accuser appear in the first instance, he
shall be attached by Pledges, if he can produce any such, to prosecute
his Suit. But, if he is unable to adduce any Pledges, it is usual to
trust to his solemn promise,<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> as in all Pleas concerning Felony.
Yet is it customary in these cases to confide in a promise, least by
exacting too hard a security, others might be deterred from making a
similar accusation.<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> Security having been taken from the Accuser to
prosecute his Plea, then, the party accused, is, as we have observed,
usually attached by safe and secure Pledges; or, if he cannot produce
any pledges, he shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">-281-</span> be cast into Prison. But, in all Pleas of
Felony, the Accused is generally dismissed on pledges,<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> except
in a Plea of Homicide, where, for the sake of striking terror, it is
otherwise enacted. The next step usually resorted to, is to appoint a
day to the parties, pending which, the usual Essoins are allowed to be
cast.</p>

<p>At length, the Accuser should propose his charge: that he had seen, or
by some other proof in Court, that he perfectly well knew, that the
Accused had conspired or done something against the King’s life; or to
move a sedition in the Realm or Army; or to have consented, or given
Counsel, or delegated an authority, towards effecting such object; and
the Accuser should allege, that he was prepared to prove his charge,
according to the direction of the Court.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<p>Should the accused, on the other hand, deny, in due manner<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> in
Court, every thing the other had asserted, it is usual to decide the
Plea by the Duel. And here it should be observed, that from the moment
the Duel is waged, in Pleas of the kind we are now treating of, neither
of the parties can add nor diminish any thing from the words employed
in waging the Duel, or, in any other measure decline or recede from his
undertaking, without being held as conquered, and liable to the penal
consequences.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">-282-</span></p>
<p>Nor can the parties be afterwards reconciled to each other, by any
other mode, than the King’s License, or that of his Justices. But if
the Appellor be conquered, he shall be amerced to the King, the nature
of which has been sufficiently explained in a former part of this work.</p>

<p>What penalties also and infamy he shall incur, if conquered, have been
sufficiently detailed. If the Accused be conquered, the Judgment that
awaits him has been mentioned just before, to which may be added, the
confiscation of all his Chattels, and the perpetual Disinherison of his
Heirs.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>Every free Man of full age is admissible as an Accuser, in a
prosecution of this kind. Should, however, a Minor bring an Appeal, he
shall be attached, in the manner we have before stated. A Rustic<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>
is also admissible; but a Woman shall not be received to make an
accusation in any plea of Felony, unless in some particular instances,
concerning which we shall presently speak. But the Accuser may, in
Pleas of the kind we are discussing, decline the Duel, either on
account of his age, or by reason of his being adjudged to have received
a Mayhem.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">-283-</span></p>

<p>But the age of the party, in such a case, ought to be sixty years or
upwards. Mayhem signifies the breaking of any bone, or injuring the
head, either by wounding or abrasion. In such case, the Accused is
obliged to purge himself by the Ordeal, that is, by the hot Iron, if he
be a free Man—by water, if he be a Rustic.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<hr class="short">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">-284-</span></p>

<h3>CHAP. II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A plea</span>, concerning the fraudulent concealment of Treasure Trove, is
usually managed, in the manner and order above stated, where a certain
Accuser appears.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> But, if a Man is accused of this crime by the
public voice only, it is not usual, according to the Law of the Land,
for him to purge himself by the Ordeal,<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> although by the Assise
a different course may be resorted to, unless he has been first
convicted, or has confessed in Court, that he has found and taken some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">-285-</span>
kind of Metal in the place in question.<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> But, if upon this fact
the party be convicted, the presumption being against him, he shall be
obliged to purge himself by the Ordeal, that he had not found or taken
any more from the place in question. In other respects, the proceedings
are as before stated.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> any one is accused of Homicide,<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> the Judgment is regulated by,
and proceeds on, the distinction before laid down. It should, however,
be observed, that it is not usual to dismiss upon pledges a person
accused of this Crime, unless in compliance with the King’s pleasure.
But there are two species of Homicide. The first is called Murder
which is secretly perpetrated—no one seeing—no one knowing of it,<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>
save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">-286-</span> the person committing it, and his Accomplices, so that Hue and
Cry<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> cannot be presently made after the Offenders, as ordained by
the Statute<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> upon this subject.</p>

<p>To prosecute an accusation of this kind no one is admissible, unless he
be of the blood of the deceased, and under such restrictions is this
rule adhered to, that the nearer Heir shall exclude the more remote
from the Appeal.<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>There is also another species of Homicide, as appears from the general
Term, which is called simple Homicide.</p>

<p>In this suit also no one is admissible to prove the Accusation, unless
he be allied in blood to the deceased,<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> or be connected with him
by the tie of Homage, or Dominion, so that he can speak of the death
upon the testimony of his own sight. It should also be added, that a
Woman<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> is heard in this suit, accusing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">-287-</span> any one of her Husband’s
death,<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> if she speak as being an Eye-witness<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> to the fact,
because Husband and Wife are one flesh. And a Woman is generally
admitted to be heard, accusing any one of having committed an injury
upon her person, as will be presently shewn. It is at the election of
the accused either to abide by the Woman’s proof, or to purge himself
by the Ordeal, from the crime imputed to him. A person accused of
Homicide is sometimes compelled to undergo the legal Purgation, if he
was taken in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">-288-</span> flight by a Crowd pursuing him, and this be regularly
proved in Court by a Jury of the County.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. IV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Crime of Burning<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> is proceeded upon, discussed and terminated,
under the form and order we have described.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. V.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Crime of Robbery<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> may also be passed over, as the suit has
nothing to distinguish it from the others.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. VI.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Crime of Rape<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> is that with which a Woman charges a Man when
she alleges, that he committed a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">-289-</span> violence on her person, whilst in
the King’s peace.<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> A Woman, having suffered any such violence, is
bound immediately, whilst the crime is recent, to go to the nearest
village, and there state the injury to respectable Men, and shew the
external marks of violence.<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> She should, in the next place, do the
same thing to the Chief Officer of the Hundred; and, lastly, she should
publicly complain of her injury in the next County Court. An accusation
of this kind being made, the Judgment is as before laid down. A Woman,
accusing any one of such a Crime, is heard in the same manner, as is
usual concerning any other personal injury which has been offered her.
But it should be understood, that it is at the Election of the Accused
in such a Case, either to submit to the burthen of making Purgation,
or to sustain the woman’s proof against him. It should likewise be
remarked, that if any one be convicted in a suit of this kind, the
Judgment will be similar to that in the foregoing suits. Nor will it
suffice, after Judgment, if the Malefactor wish to take the Woman he
has injured to Wife. For thus it would frequently happen, that Men of
servile condition would, by reason of one pollution, bring perpetual
disgrace upon Women of noble birth, or that Men of high rank would be
disgraced by inferior Women, and thus dishonor their fair lineage.
But,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">-290-</span> previously to Judgment, it is customary for the Woman and the
accused to be reconciled, by means of a marriage between them; but
this step is authorised by the License of the Prince, or that of his
Justices, and the consent of the Parents.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>CHAP. VII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> crime of Falsifying,<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> in a general sense, comprises under
it many particular species. As, for example, false Charters—false
Measures—false Money—and others of a similar description, which
contain such a falsifying, on which a person ought to be accused, and,
if convicted, condemned. The manner and order of prosecuting these
different species of the crime may be sufficiently collected, from
what has gone before. One thing, however, should be observed, that if
a person be convicted of falsifying a charter, it becomes necessary to
distinguish, whether it be a royal<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> or a private charter; because
in the former case, the party, when convicted of this offence, shall be
condemned, as in the crime of læse majesty. But, if the charter be a
private one, then, the person convicted is to be dealt with in a milder
manner, as in other inferior crimes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">-291-</span> Falsifying, which are punished
by the loss of members only, according to the will and beneficence of
the princely disposition, as we formerly observed.</p>

<h3>CHAP. VIII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> to Thefts and other Pleas which fall within the Jurisdiction of
the Sheriff,<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> as they are conducted and decided according to the
various customs of different Counties, they fall not within the scope
of my present plan, which is solely confined to the subject of the
Chief Court.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> The introductory part of this <a href="#PREFACE">Preface</a> is in imitation of
that of Justinian’s Institutes, and seems strangely to have taken the

<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> “On these last words,” says Lord Littleton, “I would
observe, that, as in those days there was no distinct Court of Equity,
the Judges of the King’s Court had probably a power of mitigating in
some cases the rigour of the Law.” (Hist. of Life Hen. 2. Vol. 3. p.
315. Oct. Ed.) A strong instance in point the Reader will find in L. 7.
c. 1. or the present Translation p. 149.</p>

in the Roman code. (Justin. Instit. L. 1. t. 2. s. 6.) It may very
justly be questioned, whether it is not here cited ironically. At all
events, the passage of our text can scarcely warrant the conclusion
the celebrated M. Houard has drawn from it. But the Reader shall have
his own words—<i><span lang="fr">Le Texte de notre Auteur prouve qu’après la conquête,

<p><a id="Footnote_46" href="#FNanchor_46" class="label">[46]</a> <i><span lang="la">Essonium</span></i>, an Excuse. Sir Edward Coke derives
the term from the French verb <i><span lang="fr">essonier</span></i> or <i><span lang="fr">exonier</span></i>. He
tells us, it is all one with what the civilians call <i><span lang="la">excusatio</span></i>.
Sir Henry Spelman mentions the same derivation, and adds, <i>ex</i>,
<i><span lang="la">privativum</span></i>, <i><span lang="fr">soing</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">cura</span></i>. The Greek word <span lang="grc">ἐξὸμνυσθαι</span> has
been proposed as another derivation, implying an excuse by means of
an oath. The term occurs so early as the Assizes of Jerusalem, (c.
58.) So limited is the doctrine of Essoins in the present day, that
it will here suffice to observe, there were five <i>principal</i>
kinds in the reign of Henry the second; I say principal, because there
were necessarily many others of less importance. These, as enumerated
by Sir Edward Coke, were; 1. <i><span lang="la">de servitio Regis</span></i>. 2. <i><span lang="la">In
terram sanctam</span></i>. 3. <i><span lang="la">Ultra mare</span></i>. 4. <i><span lang="la">De malo lecti</span></i>. 5.
<i><span lang="la">De malo veniendi</span></i>; the two last being the same as those <i><span lang="la">ex
infirmitate de reseantisâ</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">ex infirmitate veniendi</span></i>, so
frequently mentioned by our author, in the present book. Essoins are
said to have been derived to us from the Normans. (<span lang="la">Vide</span> Assises of

<p>Bracton, when treating of the subject, employs the same expression,

down, that the Tenant could not wage his Law by means of an Attorney
constituted for that purpose, but must do it personally. (Bracton

Johnson explains in his dictionary, as meaning a residence, though,
as he remarks, it is now only used in Law. In this, its simple sense,
our author has used it, in a subsequent part of his work. (L. 12. c.
7.) Yet it assumes a different meaning, as used by the old English
and Scotch Lawyers to denote an Essoin, when it indicated, as Skene
expresses it, “a long and old sickness, or a resident, heavy infirmity
and sore sickness.” (<span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span>, L. 1. c. 8.) An observation in
the margin of our author informs us, that this Essoin was synonymous
with that <i><span lang="la">de malo lecti</span></i>; in other words, this Essoin was
resorted to on account of such a severe indisposition as necessarily
confined a man to his house or bed.</p>

this latter sense, that Lord Littleton and Dr. Brady seem inclined to
think it was more generally used (Litt. Hist. Hen. 2. Vol. 3. p. 87.)
Mr. Selden, however, has, in his Treatise on Titles of Honor, proved,
that there were some very material distinctions between the terms,
and that they were far from being synonymous. Dr. Sullivan, when he
meets with the word in a Law of the conqueror, explains it as meaning
“the lower soldiers, not knighted, who had not yet got lands, but were
quartered on the Abbies.” (Lectures on Laws of England, p. 266.) Sir
John Skene interprets, what I presume is the same Term, as meaning
domestic servants. (Reg. Maj. L. 1. c. 8.) This is, I apprehend, the
true meaning of the text, notwithstanding that <i><span lang="la">Servientes</span></i>,
when connected with the terms <i><span lang="la">domini Regis</span></i>, sometimes meant
a particular description of officers, residing in every County, and

the Statute of Gloucester, observes, that “before that Statute at
the common Law, no man recovered any costs of suit, either in Plea
real, personal, or mixt:” and again, “this Statute was the first that
gave costs,” (2 Inst. 288.) In support of this position, he cites the
present chapter of our author. It is extremely difficult to discover,
how this chapter corroborates Lord Coke’s position. Our author merely
recites the opposite and floating opinions of others, and drops the
subject, without giving any thing like an opinion of his own. Lord
Coke’s doctrine may be correct; but, assuredly, Glanville cannot be
cited as one of the authorities, on which that doctrine is built.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_86" href="#FNanchor_86" class="label">[86]</a> It will not suffice, says Bracton, simply to say, “I
demand such Land, as my right,” unless the Demandant make out his
right, and shew how, and by what means, it has descended to him.
Neither will it suffice to allege, that the Ancestor was seised in his
Demesne as of his free Tenement only, or in his Demesne as of Fee only,
including, as it does, the freehold and whole possessory right, unless
it be added, that he was so seised by right, which comprises the right
of Propriety. Nor, again, will these two rights of possession and of
propriety, or the <i><span lang="fr">droit droit</span></i>, suffice, unless the Ancestor held
the Land in question in his Demesne; for if he held it in service, it
will not answer the purpose. Neither will it suffice, that the Ancestor
was seised as of Fee, and in right, and in his Demesne, unless it be
subjoined that he took the Esplees; because a momentary seisin is not
sufficient, without a taking of the Esplees, to found a Suit touching
the right of Propriety. Though all these requisites concur, it was
still necessary to add the time of the king. (Bracton 372. b. 373. a.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_88" href="#FNanchor_88" class="label">[88]</a> The judicial combat appears to have been the most ancient
mode of terminating controversies known to the northern nations in
their original settlements. For <i><span lang="la">Velleius Paterculus</span></i>, (L. 2. c.
118) apprises us, that all those questions, which were decided among
the Romans by legal trial, were terminated among the Germans by arms.
It was introduced into most, if not all, of those European nations,
whom the Gothic tribes subdued. In unison with their passion for
arms, it was consecrated by their superstition. Countenanced by their
Princes, and sanctioned not unfrequently by the Clergy, it long kept
its ground. (Montesq. Spirit of Laws.) One of the earliest restrictions
of the practice, which is said to occur in history, was that imposed by
our Henry the First, but this merely prohibited the Trial by combat, in
questions concerning property of small value. (Brussel usage des Fiefs,
vol. ii. p. 962.) Louis the Seventh, of France, followed this example,
and promulgated a similar law. This was imitated by St. Louis; but his
regulations extended only to his own demesnes, (Hist. du France par le
Père Daniel tom. 5. 259.) It was reserved for the steady and masterly
hand of our Henry the Second, to give the death blow to the Trial by
combat, by the introduction of the Grand Assise—a remedy which, if my
memory does not grossly deceive me, is said by Roger Hoveden, to have
been invented by Glanville.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_89" href="#FNanchor_89" class="label">[89]</a> The champion was relieved from the necessity of taking an
oath, that he had seen or heard the fact, and that his ancestor desired
him to deraign it, by the 41. c. West. 1. Until this alteration of
the Law took place “it seldom happened,” says the act, “but that the
champion of the Defendant (it should be Demandant, a translation the
original French requires) is forsworn.” (2 Inst. 246.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_90" href="#FNanchor_90" class="label">[90]</a> It is thus, according to Skene’s translation of the
<span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span>—“I sick ane man sayes and proponis against <i>N.</i>
that my Father, my guidshir, or my Brother, or Sister, or some other
of my Parentage or kindred, was in the possession of sic ane Land by

<p><a id="Footnote_91" href="#FNanchor_91" class="label">[91]</a> “The Trial by Champion in a Writ of Right hath been
anciently allowed by the common Law, and the Tenant in a Writ of Right
hath election, either to put himself upon the Grand Assise, or upon the
Trial by combat, by his Champion with the Champion of the Demandant;
which was instituted upon this reason, that in respect the Tenant had
lost his Evidences, or that the same were burnt or imbezeled, or that
his witnesses were dead, the Law permitted him to try it by combat
between his Champion and the Champion of the Demandant, hoping that
God would give victory to him that right had; and, of whose party the
victory fell out, for him was judgment finally given, for seldom death
ensued hereupon (for their weapons were but batounes) victory only
sufficed.”</p>

<p>Sir Edward Coke then gives the form of the champions oath; and adds,
“the champions are not bound to fight but until the stars appear; and
if the Tenant can defend himself until the stars appear, the Tenant
shall prevail.” (2 Inst. 246.)</p>

thus assisa of novel disseisin of <i><span lang="la">Juris Utrum</span></i>, &amp;c. 2. It
signified a Jury. 3. It meant a statute or law, thus <i><span lang="la">assisa panis

<p><a id="Footnote_102" href="#FNanchor_102" class="label">[102]</a> <i><span lang="la">Coram Justiciis in Banco sedentibus</span></i> is the
much controverted passage of the Text. Mr. Reeves conceives it to
mean, <i>before the Justices in open court</i>, observing, that this
phrase has been quoted by some persons to shew, that in the time of
Glanville, there were Justices <i><span lang="la">de banco</span></i>, in the modern sense of
those words, a construction, he proceeds to remark, which this passage
will certainly not warrant. (Hist. Eng. Law, 1. 125. in note.) On the
same side with Mr. Reeves we find Mr. Madox, who is, undoubtedly, a
very respectable authority, did he not indicate rather too strong an
inclination to interpret the passage, in favor of his own hypothesis.
(Madox’s Excheq. c. 19.) Lord Hale follows on the same side. “Neither,”
says he, “do I find any distinct mention of the court of <i>common</i>
Pleas in the time of this king,”—speaking of Henry the second. (Hist.
Com. Law, p. 142.) This, it must be confessed, is but negative
authority; for though it may possibly be contended, that his Lordship
viewed the doctrine of the Text in the same light as Mr. Madox and Mr.
Reeves view it, yet, it is more probable, that he had forgotten it, or
he otherwise would have noticed, if merely to refute, it. As a strong
supporter of a contrary doctrine, we find Lord Coke. (2. Inst. 22. See
also pref. to 8 Rep. and Co. Litt. 71. b. and Mr. Hargrave’s note.) The
reasons adduced by Mr. Reeves and those who concur with him, appear by
no means conclusive; and I think it would be far from difficult to give
a complete answer to them, from considering the style and manner of
expression peculiar to our author. But as this is purely a speculative
point, at least in the present day, I am not anxious to balance it
<i><span lang="la">in pulvere scholastico</span></i>, as Mr. Madox professes to do it, but
follow the high authority of Lord Coke, without pretending to assert,
that even his opinion may not here be liable to question, so very
doubtful is any conclusion which we may come to upon the subject!!</p>

That the connection of the subject shews the Assise spoken of in

with clearness of expression, than compatible with the dignity of a
proceeding, intended in its object to effect so remarkable a revolution
in our judicial polity, as the abolishing of the Duel, to attach some
honorable term of distinction to it.</p>

levatis</span></i>, 27. Ed. 1. Mr. Barrington observes, “the Statute consists
of four chapters, and the first states, the great perjury which
prevailed among Jurors at this time, which offence <i>in a witness</i>
was not now punishable by any Act of Parliament; it may be perhaps
thought a reflection on the common Law to assert, that this crime was
totally disregarded, but yet we do not hear of any such prosecution,
except the attaint of a Jury be considered as such.” (Observ. on Anc.
Stat. 176.) It will not, I trust, be considered as a want of respect
for the high authority in question, to observe, that the general
position intended to be supported, seems to be refuted by the latter
part of the passage, if, as I conceive, the <i>Juror</i> was, in those
times, of necessity a <i>witness</i>: it was part of his qualification
that he was a witness, the two characters being then blended. This
is, I submit, evident from the <a href="#BOOK2_CHAP_XVII">17th chapter of the present book</a>. A
separation of character seems to have been the gradual effect of
posterior times. Nor is this all. The punishment of a Juror, when
guilty of perjury, appears from the present chapter of Glanville to
have been imposed by an Act of Parliament. If this Act, like most, if
not all, of those mentioned in the following pages, be not now extant,
it is assuredly no small part of the merit of Glanville, that he has
preserved the substance of those public Records, of which no other
trace can be found.</p>

by Combat. Dr. Cowell, however, prefers deriving <i><span lang="la">warrantia</span></i> from
the French <i><span lang="fr">garantie</span></i> or <i><span lang="fr">garant</span></i>. The Doctor notices the
<i><span lang="la">stipulatio</span></i> of the Civilians, but, as he observes, “this reacheth
not so far as our warranty.” The term, it seems, is of great antiquity,
and is said not to have been unknown to the <i>Longobardi</i> in their
original settlements. (Spelm. Gloss. ad voc. and Cowell’s Interpreter,

<p><a id="Footnote_123" href="#FNanchor_123" class="label">[123]</a> <i><span lang="la">Escambium</span></i>, a term used in Domesday. Sir Edward
Coke, in speaking of a warranty, observes, that it is a covenant real,
annexed to Lands, whereby a man and his heirs are bound to warrant the
same “and to yield other Lands and Tenements (which in old books is
called <i><span lang="la">in Excambio</span></i>) to the value of those that shall be evicted
by a former title.” (See Co. Litt. 365. a. and 51 b.) It should seem
from Bracton, that if the warrantor had not sufficient property to make
a full restitution, he was to do so as far as his property extended,
and the Tenant was to wait, until better times, for the deficiency.
If the Warrantor had no property, he was not, from that circumstance,
to be entirely absolved from making restitution, whilst there was any
probability of his inheriting property from that person, on account of
whom he was called to warrant.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he was not bound to warrant the deed of his
ancestor, at the expense of any purchase made by himself.—Nor was the
recompense to be estimated, beyond the value of the property at the
time it was originally warranted.—Nor was one of many warrantors,
required to bear the burthen solely, the others being obliged to
contribute, (Bracton 394. b. 395. a. See also le Grand Custum. de Norm.

proceeds out of the inferior courts by precept; an attachment, out
of the superior courts by precept, or writ. (Lamb. Eiren. L. 1. c.
16.) An Arrest lies only against the body of a Man; an Attachment,
sometimes against the goods only. Thus Kitch. (fol. 279. b.) says, a
man may attach a cow; and, in another case, that a man may be attached
by a hundred sheep; and it is sometimes awarded against the body and
goods together. An Attachment is said to differ from a <i><span lang="la">capias</span></i>,
because the former is more general and extends to the taking of the
goods, a capias extending to the body only. An Attachment is laid
down as differing from a <i>Distress</i>, inasmuch as it is a Process

<p><a id="Footnote_149" href="#FNanchor_149" class="label">[149]</a> The Mirror enumerates many other modes by which a
Villein was enfranchised, besides those stated by Glanville, which
appear rather to be put for examples, than as comprising all the
instances of emancipation; and the Mirror confirms most, if not all, of
the Examples in the text. (c. 2. s. 28.) The <span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span> informs
us, that Holy Orders enfranchised, if taken with the consent of the
Lord. The Villein was also enfranchised, if the Lord seduced his wife,
for the Law permitted the Villein to receive no other amends. The
Villein was likewise emancipated, if the Lord drew blood of him, or,
if the Lord refused to bail him, either in a civil or criminal action
in which he was afterwards cleared by Trial. (<span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span>, L. 2.
c. 12.) The act of enfranchisement, when not arising by implication
of Law, of which description many of the instances appear to be, was,
in ancient times and before writing was common, accompanied by much
publicity and ceremony. <i><span lang="la">Qui servum suum liberum facit in Ecclesiâ,
vel Mercato, vel Comitatu, vel Hundredo, coram testibus et palam
faciat, et liberas ei vias et portas conscribit apertas, et lanceam et
gladium vel quæ liberorum arma in manibus ei ponat.</span></i> (Anglo-Sax.
LL. Ed. Wilkins.) When writing became common, the method was, by the
Lord’s Deed expressly enfranchising the Villein. Upon the subject of
Villenage, Fortescue’s words are no less remarkable for the truth
and beauty of the sentiment they express, than singular, when it is
considered that they were addressed to a Prince. <i><span lang="la">Ab homine et pro
vitio introducta est servitus: sed Libertas à Deo hominis est insita
naturæ. Quare ipsi ab homine sublata semper redire gliscit, ut facit

of judicial proceedings. (3 Hist. Hen. 2. p. 192.) It more probably
originated from the chivalric pride of the times. As the great Lords
often personally engaged in the combat, their own importance was
increased by keeping up the dignity of this mode of Trial.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_155" href="#FNanchor_155" class="label">[155]</a> From the extreme brevity and quaintness of the original,
it is a matter of some doubt, what the true meaning of the passage is.
Lord Littleton gives the passage thus. “We are told by Glanville, that
in his time, if a freeman married a woman born in Villenage <i>and who
actually lived in that state</i>, he lost thereby the benefit of the
Law (that is all the legal rights of a freeman,) and was considered
as a Villein by birth, during the lifetime of his wife, on account
of her Villenage.” This, however, is at best but a loose paraphrase
of Glanville. His Lordship was aware of it, and to confirm his
representation of what is said, as he terms it, so <i>indistinctly</i>
by Glanville, he refers to Bracton, fol. 5. Mr. Reeves makes
this severe penalty upon the Husband to arise, not from the wife
<i>living</i> in a state of Villenage, but her <i>holding property in
Villenage</i>. The fact is, the text expresses neither Lord Littleton’s
Explanation, nor that given by Mr. Reeves. I do not flatter myself to
have succeeded better. In Britton’s time, the wife was enfranchised
during the coverture. (78. b.) <span lang="la">Vide</span> Co. Litt. 123. a. and 137. b. and

Edward Coke, “<i><span lang="la">ex donatione, et est quasi donarium</span></i>.” (Co. Litt.
30. b.) Cowell and Spelman, however, both deduce it from the French
<i><span lang="fr">douaire</span></i>. (Cowell and Spelman’s Gloss. ad voc.) The real objects
of Dower are sustenance for the wife, and nurture and education for
the children. (Fleta L. 5. Cap. 23.) The <i>Romans</i> were not in the
habit of endowing their wives. When, therefore, <i>Tacitus</i> met
with this peculiarity among the <i>Germans</i>, he was struck with it.
<i><span lang="la">Dotem non Uxor marito sed uxori maritus affert.</span></i> (Tacit. de mor.
German. 18.) Though Dower was unknown to the Romans, it seems to have
been in use amongst the ancient <i>Hebrews</i>, (Gen. 34. 12. Exodus
22. 16. et al.) Nor was it unknown to the <i>Grecians</i>, if we may
judge from that part of the Odyssey where Vulcan reclaims the Dower
he had given to his frail wife. It seems to have been known to the
ancient <i>Gauls</i>, (Cæsar, <span lang="la">de bello Gallico</span> L. 6. c. 18.) And to the
<i><span lang="la">Cantabri</span></i>, (Strabo L. 3.) <i>Craig</i>, however, doubts whether
there was any such thing as dower amongst the ancient Northern Nations.
(Jus Feud. L. 2. Dieg. 14.) The <i>Goths</i> did not allow Dower to
exceed a <i>tenth</i>. (Wisegoth. L. 3. t. 1. l. 4.)</p>

allowed Dower to extend to the <i>fourth</i> part. (L. 2. tit. 4.) The
<i>English</i>, the <i>Scotch</i>, and the <i>Normans</i>, following
in this respect the <i>Sicilians</i> and <i>Neapolitans</i>, have
allowed Dower to extend to a <i>third</i>. (<span lang="la">Vide</span> LL. Hen. 1. 70. Ed.

<p><a id="Footnote_165" href="#FNanchor_165" class="label">[165]</a> It is curious to observe the fluctuations of Law.
Though Glanville in the text expressly lays it down, that a Woman may
be endowed of chattels, or money, which, indeed, could have been the
only mode of endowing in the still more distant ages of Antiquity, yet
this was denied to be law in the Reign of Henry the fourth, (7. H. 4.
13. b.) The Doctrine of the Courts of Equity in the present day, in
admitting equitable bars, seems, in point of substance, to revive the
law as laid down by Glanville. The doctrine of the text is confirmed
by the <span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span>, and Fleta: but the latter informs us, that
Dowers, of the kind now under discussion, were only so far to be
recovered, as the chattels of the deceased extended. (L. 5. c. 23.)
Hence probably they fell into disuse.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_168" href="#FNanchor_168" class="label">[168]</a> For which Rule Bracton gives two reasons: <i>1st.</i>
Because the woman has no freehold in her Dower, previously to its being
assigned. <i>2ly.</i> Because she cannot gainsay her Husband. (Bracton

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_169" href="#FNanchor_169" class="label">[169]</a> I have followed all the MSS. and the Edition of
Glanville published in 1604, in admitting <i>not</i> into the text.
I submit, that this Reading is sanctioned not merely by the previous
part of this present chapter, but also by the <a href="#BOOK6_CHAP_XIII">13th chapter of the
present Book</a>. Yet the <span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span> makes the validity of such a
sale to depend upon the wife’s consent—but, if she made no opposition
to it, it seems to have been tantamount to a positive consent. (L. 2.
c. 15. 16.) From considering the <a href="#BOOK6_CHAP_XIII">13th Chapter of the present Book</a>,
one thing seems clear—that in case the Husband disposed of his Wife’s
dower, the Heir was bound to render an equivalent to the Purchaser,
if the Land was recovered from him, or to the Wife, if it was not so.
As to the Heir, therefore, it was immaterial; and so it perhaps might
be considered with respect to the Wife and the Purchaser, in case the
Heir, as Heir, were solvent; but if otherwise, it was highly material
to ascertain, whose right, that of the Wife or that of the Purchaser,
was paramount. Bracton is more explicit than our Author; and from him
we collect, that a distinction should be made, whether the Dower was
originally <i>named</i>, or not. In the <i>former</i> case, the woman
could pursue the identical Dower, and wrest it from the hands even of a
Purchaser. In the <i>latter</i> she was obliged to resort to the Heir
for an Equivalent. In the first case, from the moment the dower was
named, the woman acquired a certain <i><span lang="la">jus et dominium</span></i> as Bracton
expresses it, in the property, which accompanied it into whatever hands
it afterwards went, and gave her the right of following and reclaiming
it. But, if the endowment were general, and no particular land
specified, the Wife did not acquire any immediate right, on account of
the uncertainty; it being questionable, what identical allotment would
fall to her share, until the assignment took place. (Bracton 300. b.)</p>

land had been, in the first place, specifically nominated, on which
there was no messuage. This inference is corroborated by Bracton. (97.
b.) It was certainly a qualification of the severity of the Rule,
which would turn the Widow out of that House she might possibly long
have occupied with her Husband as its mistress. The Widow had further
advantages under the 7th chap. of Mag. Car. These different regulations
in favor of the Widow, tended to restore the common Law as it stood in
the Reign of Canute. <i><span lang="la">Ubi Maritus habitavit absque lite et absque

<p><a id="Footnote_190" href="#FNanchor_190" class="label">[190]</a> From a Law of Edmund, which is in every sense of the
word a most singular specimen of legislation, the translator makes the
following extract:—<i><span lang="la">Si eam</span></i> (the wife) <i><span lang="la">ex terra illa ducere
velit in alterius Thani regionem, tunc sponsio ipsius sit quam Amici
paciscantur, ut Maritus ejus nullam illi injuriam inferat, et si illa
delictum commiserit, ut possint esse propinquiores emendationi, si
illa non habeat unde compenset.</span></i> (LL. Edm. Ed. Wilkins.) This was
certainly a more polite mode of proceeding than Canute allowed. Under
his Law, the wife, if guilty of the offence in the lifetime of her
Husband, became infamous, forfeited every thing she possessed to her
Husband, and lost both her nose and ears. (LL. Canuti—Ibid.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_192" href="#FNanchor_192" class="label">[192]</a> Upon this Rule of Law, Lord Littleton observes, “as
the Canonical prohibitions extended so far, that divorces frequently
happened, after a cohabitation of many years in a state of wedlock
supposed lawful, there was much humanity and equity in this Law,”
especially as his Lordship had just observed “such a separation
supposed a nullity in the marriage, and the children must in strictness
have been bastardised by it,” had it not thus have been tempered and
relaxed. (3 Litt. Hist. Hen. 2. p. 126.)</p>

<p>A similar Law forms part of the Modern French code, though clearly the
result of different principles—“Dissolution of marriage by Divorce,
allowed at Law, shall not deprive the children born of the marriage of
any of the advantages which were assured to them by the Laws, or by
the marriage contracts of their Father and Mother.” (Code Napoleon, s.
304.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_193" href="#FNanchor_193" class="label">[193]</a> According to the Norman Code, if the Husband, at the
time of the marriage, had no Fee, but his father or Grandfather had
been present and consented to the marriage, the wife might be endowed
out of the Land of the Father or Grandfather, provided there were
no other Heirs: if, however, such Father or Grandfather had other
Heirs, then, she was to be endowed out of the portion descending to
her Husband. But, if the Father or Grandfather did not consent to the
marriage, she was entitled to no Dower out of their Lands. (Le Grand
Cust. de Normand. c. 102.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_194" href="#FNanchor_194" class="label">[194]</a> This is put as a question in the printed text, although

wife cannot claim any more in Dower than that of which she has been
so endowed. That the printed text is correct seems probable: for we

as this <i>reasonable part</i>. In speaking of the Constitutions of
the ancient kings, the Mirror tells us, that “none might alien but the
fourth part of his Inheritance, without the consent of his Heirs.”
(c. 1. s. 3.) Whether this removes the difficulty, is for the Reader
to decide. The 32nd chapter of Mag. Car. intended to provide a remedy
for the abuse of the indulgence stated in the text—which was again
affected by the Statute of <i><span lang="la">quia Emptores</span></i>. The modern French code
restrains a gift to the moiety of a man’s property, if he leaves one
child—to a third of it, if he leaves two—and to a fourth if he leaves
three children. Nor does it seem that a man is free from restraint,
though he have no child, provided he has Relatives, either Ascendants
or Descendants. But, in default of all these, the restraint ceases, and
a man may dispose of the whole of his property. (Code Napoleon, s. 913.

power of wantonly disinheriting the Heir by will, and transferring the
Estate, through the dotage or caprice of the Ancestor, from those of
his blood to utter strangers. For this, it is alleged, maintained the
balance of property, and prevented one man growing too big or powerful
for his neighbours.” (2 Bl. Comm. 373.)</p>

illegitimate Son of any part of the former’s hereditary Estate, adding
that it might be impeached within a year and a day after the Father’s
decease. (Le Grand Custum. de Norm. c. 36.) We must recollect that both

in the old restraints upon alienation, which we find in the Laws of
England and Scotland, no distinction is made, whether the fief was held
by a military or socage tenure; and that, in the same old Laws, the
restraint upon alienation is almost absolute, where the Tenant is in by
descent, but very loose when he is in by purchase; and the writer in
question concludes that, the <i>Interest of the Heir</i> created the

<p><a id="Footnote_212" href="#FNanchor_212" class="label">[212]</a> An able writer accounts for this principle by informing
us, that the whole feudal system was built on the distinct rights of
superior and vassal, and the blending these two characters, without a
necessity arising from the feudal relations themselves, in one person,
appeared to be blending of contrary qualities together. (Dalrymple’s
Essay on feuds, p. 177.) Mr. Reeves observes, “that in the times of
Glanville and Bracton the reservation of services might be made either
to the Feoffor, or to the Lord of whom the Feoffor held; they seem more
commonly to have been made in the former manner: thus, every such new
feoffment in fee, made a new tenure, and of course created a new manor:
and so the Law continued till the statute <i><span lang="la">quia Emptores</span></i> 18.
Ed. 1. required feoffments in fee to be made, with reservation of the
Services to the chief Lord.” (1 Hist. Eng. Law. 106.) See also Hale’s

“so far as it is <i>affirmative</i>, and relates to lineal descents, is
almost universally adopted by all nations;” “but the <i>negative</i>
branch, or total exclusion of Parents and all lineal Ancestors from
succeeding to the Inheritance of their offspring, is peculiar to our
own Laws, and such as have been derived from the same original.” (2
Com. 209.)</p>

<p>The Reader will recal to mind the material qualification of this Rule,
which, though it precludes the Father from taking as Heir to his Son,
by an <i>immediate</i> descent, permits him to take as Heir to his own
Brother, who was Heir to the Son, by <i>collateral</i> descent. (Hale’s
Hist. Com. Law. 216. 336. 2 P. Wms. 613. Mr. Christian’s note to 2

Bracton; for, having laid it down, that an Inheritance never ascends
the same way it descends, he proceeds, <i><span lang="la">a latere tamen ascendit
alicui propter defectum heredum inferius provenientium</span></i>. (Bracton

proper to change the spiritual tenure of frankalmoigne or free-alms,

did not (as we before have noted) till feuds were grown perpetual.
The reason, as I take it, that begat this alteration was, for that
while the feud did descend in Gavelkynd to the sons and nephews of the
feudatory, the services were suspended, till the Lord had chosen which
of the sons he would have for his Tenant, and then it was uncertain,
whether the party chosen would accept of the feud or not, for sometimes
there might be reasons to refuse it.” (Spelm. Reliq. p. 43. See also 3

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_225" href="#FNanchor_225" class="label">[225]</a> Socage Lands are asserted to have remained partible
long after the Conquest, and, as we have no account of the precise
period when the alteration was made in the descent of these Lands from
all the Sons equally to the Eldest Son only, it is probable, as Mr.
Robinson suggests, that the alteration was not effected at once nor by
any written Law, but crept in insensibly and by degrees, in imitation
of the Descents of Knight’s Service, and from the pride of the Socage
Tenant, emulous that his Eldest Son should equal in state and splendor
the military Tenant. “But this alteration began to appear more plainly
in the time of Henry the 2nd. for, according to <i>Glanville</i>, who
wrote in that Reign, in order to entitle the Sons to take equally, it
was not only necessary that the Land should be holden in free socage,
but further <i><span lang="la">quod antiquitus divisum</span></i>”—and, having cited the
present and following passages of our author, Mr. Robinson proceeds
“So that according to this account, it is difficult to say, what was
then the common Law with regard to descents of socage Lands, or whether
every person entitling himself to them by Inheritance, was not obliged
to set out the special custom of the place. The same author, indeed, in
other parts of his Book, speaks of the partibility of these Lands more
generally, and in such manner as may induce a belief, that it remained
the common Law at that time: <i><span lang="la">Plurium item hæredum conjunctio
mulierum scil. in feodo militari vel masculorum vel fœminarum in libero
socagio.</span></i> (L. 13. c. 11.) And, in another very remarkable passage,
wherein he shews, that the Law so greatly respected this equal division
among the Sons, as not to permit the Father even in his lifetime to
prefer a favorite child to any of the rest, by advancing him beyond
his proportionable part”—referring to the <a href="#BOOK7_CHAP_I">first chapter of the present
Book</a>. (Robinson on Gavelkynd 24. 25.) The two latter positions referred
to by Mr. Robinson, as laid down by Glanville, may be accounted for by
supposing, that our author speaks with reference to Land “<i><span lang="la">antiquitus
divisa</span></i>.” “Although,” says Lord Hale, commenting upon a passage in
our author’s text, “Custom directed the Descent variously, either to
the Eldest or Youngest, or to all the Sons, yet, it seems, that at
this time, <i><span lang="la">Commune Jus</span></i>, or Common right spoke for the Eldest
Son to be Heir, no custom intervening to the contrary.” (Hist. Com.
Law 226.) To conclude, the right of primogeniture every day making a
greater progress had, as Mr. Robinson observes, in the Reign of King
John fairly got the upper hand of the partible descent, the presumption
then being that even Socage Lands (unless in Kent) were descendible
to the Eldest Son only, unless the contrary were proved. (26.) Upon
the doctrine of the text and the subject of this note, see the authors
referred to; also Bracton 76. a. Fleta L. 5. c. 9. s. 15. Mirror c. 1.

The transition is easy from the person of the Elder to his privilege
or the right of Seniority. (Spelm. Gloss. ad voc.) The term occurs in
the Statute of Marlbridge, Fleta, Bracton, Norman Custumary &amp;c. Among
the customs of Beauvoisis, we find a Law similar to that in our text.

The chief distinctions between the two former <i>as stated by that
author</i>, are, 1st, The manner of performing Homage was much more
humble and impressive, than that of performing Fealty. 2nd, Homage was
due for a military Fee alone; a Rule that if it ever prevailed was
relaxed by the English Law. 3rd, Homage could only be received by the
Lord personally, fealty might be received by a Bailiff. 4th, Those who
held by Homage were bound to sell or pledge every thing for their Lord;
but the tenant by simple fealty had no such heavy obligation imposed
upon him. (Craig Jus Feud. L. 1. D. 11. 10).</p>

customs of Gavelkynd, highly probable as it is, that those customs
are the valuable relics of the old common Law. “Let the goods of
gavelkynd Persons,” says the <i>Custumal of Kent</i>, “be parted
into three parts, after the funerals and the debts paid, if there be
lawful Issue in life. So that the dead have one part, and his lawful
sons and daughters another part, and the wife the third part: and,
if there be no lawful issue in life, let the dead have the one half,
and the wife alive the other half.” (<span lang="la">vide</span> Robins. on Gavelkynd, 287.)
Lord Hale recognises the doctrine in the text, which, he tells us, was
conformable to the ancient Law of England and the custom of the North
to this day. (Hist. Com. Law. 192. 225.) It is likewise confirmed by
the <span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span>, (L. 2. c. 37) and in substance by Bracton, and
Fleta.—Yet, notwithstanding all this, Lord Coke, in his Commentary
on Magna Carta, roundly asserts, that the doctrine laid down in the
text, never was the Common Law; (2 Inst. 32) and, in support of this
position, he cites a passage from Bracton.</p>

<p>To that passage, I have turned. Bracton there confirms the text of
Glanville, and tells us, that the Law is so, unless in some cities and
boroughs.—This leads him to mention the custom of London, and some
floating opinions about its extent. He is of opinion, that the will
of a citizen of London ought to be free, and unrestrained by any such
limitation, as was imposed upon wills by the common Law. But Lord Coke
has hastily assumed, that what Bracton spoke <i>of the custom of London
only</i>, related to the kingdom at large. As this assumption fails,
the deduction that flowed from it fails also. Sir William Blackstone, I
find, has mentioned and refuted Lord Coke’s mistake. (2 Comm. 492) as
has Mr. Somner in his Treatise on Gavelkynd, p. 96. To these authors,
the reader may refer, as also to Reeves’s Hist. Eng. Law. 2. 334.
335. and F.N.B. 270. In concluding this note, I shall mention, the
course of distribution of an Intestate’s Effects under the Laws of
Canute, and the conqueror. Under the <i>former</i>, the Lord took the
Heriot, and the remainder was distributed between the wife, children,
and relatives, <i><span lang="la">cuilibet pro dignitate quæ ad cum pertinet</span></i>.
(LL. Canuti, 68.) Under the <i>latter</i>, the children divided the
Inheritance equally between them. (LL. Gul. Conq. 36.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_242" href="#FNanchor_242" class="label">[242]</a> Bracton and Fleta perfectly concur with our author,
except that they use the word <i>children</i> instead of Heir, adding,
that if the deceased had no children, then, the one half was at his own
disposal, the other belongs to the wife; and, if he had neither wife
nor child, the whole was at his own disposal. (Bracton 60. b. Fleta L.
2. c. 57. s. 10.) Before we quit the present chapter, it may not be
amiss to observe, that Glanville has been thought grossly to contradict
himself in the course of it. But this has been inconsiderately imputed
to him by those, who have not attended to the context. He states, that
according to certain customs, which prevailed in particular places,
a man was bound to remember his Lord, and the Church, previously to
his making his will. But, says he, whatever those customs inculcate,
yet, according to the Law of the realm, no man is bound to leave any
thing <i>to any particular person</i>, unless it be his inclination,
for every man’s will is free, <i>over that part of his property which
the Law permits him to dispose of, namely, a third, or, eventually,
a half</i>—When our author laid it down, that a man’s will was to be
free, he did not mean to assert, that he was at liberty to dispose of
<i>all</i> his property. Should it in the present day be laid down,
that a Testator’s will was free, and that he was not bound to give
any thing to any particular individual, would it be a fair inference,
that a man could devise his <i>entailed</i> Lands? It we apply this
to Glanville, he is consistent, and will be understood to speak, with
reference to persons, what he has been considered to speak, with
respect to things. That the division of the property, mentioned in the
text, did not long survive the time of Glanville, is most probable.
(See Somner on Gavelk. p. 98.) Swinburne seems strangely to have
blundered in thinking, that our author took part of his text from Magna
Carta, (Swinburne on Wills, part 3. section 16.) The passing of which
was an event clearly <i>posterior</i> in time to Glanville.</p>

The transition is by no means difficult; and, in its application to

punishment for the frailty of a single woman, and without example in
other Laws: but it undoubtedly arose, not so much from a rigorous sense
of the heinousness of the fault, as from the notion of an advantage due
to the Lord from the marriage of his ward, which he probably might be

solemnization of Matrimony where Matrimony followed, should be as
legitimate to inherit unto their ancestors, as those that were born
after Matrimony.” (2 Inst. 96.) To this Constitution our Author
alludes. The doctrine of the Norman Code is in conformity with the
Canon of Alexander. (Grand Custum. c. 27.) The modern French Code
allows, under certain restrictions, of the subsequent legitimation of
children—even of deceased children, who have left issue. (Code Napoleon

<p><a id="Footnote_275" href="#FNanchor_275" class="label">[275]</a> “This decision of Glanville,” observes Lord Littleton,
“is very remarkable: as it shews the entire independence of the Law
of England on the Canon and Civil Laws in his time.” (3 Litt. Hist.
Hen. 2. p. 125.) When this doctrine was, in a subsequent period of our
History, attempted to be overturned, it gave rise to the celebrated
answer of the Barons recorded in our Statute Book.—<i><span lang="la">Et omnes Comites
et Barones unâ voce responderunt, quod nolunt leges Angliæ mutare, quæ
hucusque usitatæ sunt et approbatæ.</span></i> (Stat. of Merton. c. 9. See

Man may succeed to him, but only the King by the reason aforesaid.”
(L. 2. c. 52.) But Bracton resolves the question by informing us, that
in such a case, the Land would escheat to the Lord; nor, would the
circumstance of Homage having been received, alter the case, <i><span lang="la">quia
homagium evanescit heredibus deficientibus ubique</span></i>; (Bracton 20.
b.) a doctrine which has been strangely misinterpreted, and that by
a highly respectable writer, who considers the position laid down by
Glanville, that the Lord was precluded by receiving Homage of his
claim to the Escheat, as not to be relied upon; because, <i>in the
very next Reign</i>, the Lord was <i><span lang="la">ultimus heres</span></i> to a Bastard.
In support of this conjecture, the Author in question appeals to
Bracton. (Ubi supra.) See Dalrymple on Feuds p. 64. Bracton wrote the
Law of the times as it stood when he composed his treatise, which was
not <i>in the very next Reign</i>, but towards the latter end of the
Reign of Henry the third, the better part of a century later than when
Glanville wrote. Had the fact, however, been as assumed, the conclusion
drawn from it would by no means be warranted: since, to argue from
what is Law at one period in order to refute what was so at another
<i>anterior</i> period is the purest sophistry.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_277" href="#FNanchor_277" class="label">[277]</a> The Ancient <i>Romans</i> punished Usury with more
severity, than they did Theft. (<span lang="la">Cato de re Rusticâ Proem.</span>) The
<i>Norman</i> code imposes a forfeiture of all the offender’s property,
provided he had been guilty of Usury, within a year and a day before
his death. (Grand Custum. de Norm. c. 20.)</p>

<p>By a Law of Edward the Confessor, Usurers were banished the kingdom,
and a person convicted of the crime forfeited all his substance,
and was to be treated as an outlaw. If the Reader feel any desire
to penetrate into the motives that dictated this Law, these are the
concluding words of it. <i><span lang="la">Hoc autem asserebat ipse Rex se audiisse in
Curia Regis Francorum, dum ibidem moraretur, quod Usura radix omnium
vitiorum esset.</span></i> (LL. Ed. Conf. c. 37.) The doctrine, as laid down
by the Mirror, is, that the goods and Chattels of Usurers should
remain, as Escheats to the Lords of the Fee. (Mirror c. 1. s. 3.) The
Reader will find some curious disquisitions on the subject of Usury in
the Ancient Dialog. de Scaccario. (L. 2. s. 10.)</p>

Monarch. Lord Coke, however, ascribes to them a much earlier origin;
and from the Records in the Exchequer, it should seem, that there
had been Justices Itinerant to hear and determine Civil and Criminal
causes, so early as the 18th of Henry the first. Lord Littleton thinks,
the first appointment of Justices Itinerant was made by Henry the
first, in imitation of a similar Institution in France established
by Louis le Gros. Justices Itinerant <i><span lang="la">ad communia placita</span></i> were
continued until the 10th of Edw. the 3rd, when they seem to have given
way to Justices of Assise, Nisi prius, Oyer and terminer, and Gaol

<p><a id="Footnote_287" href="#FNanchor_287" class="label">[287]</a> “The reason of this,” says Lord Littleton, “was a
supposition, that the Lord, of whom the felon held, was in some degree
culpable, for want of a proper care in the choice of his Tenant.”
(2 Hist. Hen. 2. p. 118.) It is difficult to feel the force of this
reasoning, from the moment fiefs ceased to be given for the life of
the feudatory—for what <i>choice</i>, it may be asked, was left to
the Lord, when fiefs were hereditary, as they clearly appear to have
been when Glanville wrote, and for some time previously. Lord Coke
ascribes the rule to another source, laying it down, that originally
the King was to have no benefit from the attainder, but was to commit
destruction to the property of the offender in detestation of the
crime, <i><span lang="la">ut pœna ad paucos, metus ad omnes perveniat</span></i>. (2 Inst.
36.) But this is as far from being satisfactory, as the reason given
by Lord Littleton. Because, as the property had ceased to belong to
the offender, any waste committed on it redounded in the first place
to the injury of the Lord, and through him to the public, who were
both, laying all technical fictions aside, innocent. The punishment to
the Tenant was the <i>forfeiture</i>, and not the waste subsequently
committed. This cruel policy, or rather impolicy, was abrogated by
the 22nd Chapter of Magna Carta. The Reader will consult Lord Coke’s
comment on that Chapter, and then judge for himself, whether the year
and a day came in lieu of the waste. That they were co-existent seems
strongly corroborated by the Custumal of Kent—“The King shall have the
year <i>and</i> the waste.” (Robinson on Gavelk. 284. See also Ibid c.
4.) The Mirror is here, as in many other instances, at variance with
itself. But Britton appears to consider them as co-existent. (c. 18. s.
6.) and so does the <span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span>. (L. 2. c. 55.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_295" href="#FNanchor_295" class="label">[295]</a> What our Author treats of, as a consequence of a
Man’s receiving lands in marriage-hood, has received considerable
extension in succeeding times, and has become known by the Title of the
<i>Curtesy of England</i>. But, as Lord Coke observes, it was known to
the <i>Scotch</i> and <i>Irish</i>, and, he might have added, to the
<i>Normans</i>. Craig cites a passage to shew that it was not unknown
to the <i>Roman</i> Code, and Sir Wm. Blackstone quotes an authority
to prove that it was in use amongst the ancient <i>Almains</i> or
<i>Germans</i>. Like Dower, it is not a provision arising from the
compact of the parties, but emanating from the liberality of the Law.
As to the evidence of the existence of the offspring, the Regiam
Majestatem expressly coincides with our Author, (L. 2. c. 58.) and in
this, is followed by Bracton, Fleta, and Britton. Lord Coke, however,
asserts, that if born alive, it is sufficient, though not heard to
cry, which, indeed, is consistent with reason—for the crying of the
child is merely <i>evidence</i> of life—which may as well be furnished
by a thousand other circumstances. It is not improbable, that as an
adherence to the strict Letter of the ancient Law, as laid down by
Glanville, had been found extremely inconvenient, it had, therefore,
been silently abrogated, previous to the time of Lord Coke. (See Craig

<p><a id="Footnote_300" href="#FNanchor_300" class="label">[300]</a> This and a similar passage, in the following chapter,
afford strong <i>data</i>, from whence to ascertain the year, when the
present work was written. Admitted as it is, on all hands, that it
was composed in the Reign of Henry the Second, and it being a strong
presumption from the passages in question, that it could not have been
written antecedent to the 33d year of such Reign, it merely remains for
us to chuse between the 33d, 34th, and 35th years; for on the latter
year the Reign terminated. If we follow Sir Henry Spelman’s plan, and
divide the intermediate period, we should infer that the present work
was written in the 34th year of Henry the Second, in other words, in
1187. Dr. Robertson, though without alleging any reason, says, it was
composed about the year 1181. (Hist. Charles. V. vol. 1. p. 296.)

informs us, <i><span lang="la">pro libertate faldagii</span></i>—<i><span lang="la">faldagium</span></i> being
a privilege, which Lords anciently, not unfrequently, reserved to
themselves, of setting up folds for sheep in any fields within their
manors, the better to feed their flocks, and this, not merely with
their own but their Tenants’ sheep, although, in the latter case, the
privilege was more usually called <i><span lang="la">secta faldæ</span></i>.</p>

<p>It should rather seem, that the Tenants sometimes enjoyed such a
privilege as against their Lords. <i><span lang="la">Falda</span></i> i.e. <i><span lang="la">homines
villæ debent ponere oves suas in faldam Domini</span></i>, are the words
of an ancient MS. relating to the Monastery of St. Edmund. When the
term <i><span lang="la">forinsecas</span></i> is attached to <i><span lang="la">faldas</span></i>, a difficulty
occurs, which perhaps may be got over by recurring to the doctrine
of subinfeudation, so common when Glanville wrote. The privilege in
question might have been <i>within</i> the boundaries of the ancient or
original manor, whilst it might have been external or <i>without</i>
the circuit of a less manor, forming merely a part of the original
manor and created in a course of posterior subinfeudation.—This is
submitted merely as a conjecture.</p>

in order to compel their Tenants’ Services, and to maintain peace

Court, Lords caused Records to be made before their own officers
of the transactions which had taken place in their Courts. But, as
these Records derived their chief or rather only strength, from the
parties voluntarily submitting to them, the authority of the Lords
was gradually weakened; and, as murmurs began to increase against the
decisions of their Courts, a reference to the King’s Court became the

<p><a id="Footnote_324" href="#FNanchor_324" class="label">[324]</a> <i>Homage</i>, the result of the Feudal System, was
unknown to the Romans; and Spelman thinks, it was unknown to the
Anglo-Saxons. (Reliq. p. 34.) However that may be, William the
Conqueror is stated to have received it from the Nobles, immediately
after the Battle of Hastings. (M. Paris.) It is generally derived
from the word <i><span lang="la">homo</span></i>, which, as well as our synonymous term
<i>man</i>, Spelman asserts, to have been used for many ages by the
German and Western Nations, for a servant or vassal. (Spelm. ubi
supra—<span lang="la">sed vide</span> Co. Litt. 64. b.) Homage is divided into <i>liege</i>
and <i>feudal</i>: the former was due to the King, the latter to the
Lord, of whom the Tenant held his Fee. “The reason of Homage,” says
Spelman, “was to preserve the memory of the tenure, and of the duty of
the Tenant, by making every new Tenant at his entry to recognise the
Interest of his Lord, lest that the feud, being now hereditary, and new
Heirs continually succeeding to it, they might by little and little
forget their duty and subtracting their services deny at last the
tenure itself.” (Spelm. Reliq. 34.) On Homage in general see Bracton

but she shall not say, <i><span lang="fr">Jeo devigne votre feme</span></i>, but <i><span lang="fr">Jeo face
à vous homage</span></i>; and so is Glanville to be understood, that she
shall not do complete Homage.” (Co. Litt. 65. b.) Having cited this
passage, a noble Historian observes “But I should rather think, that
in Glanville’s time single women did none, and that the alteration
in the form, which is mentioned by Littleton, was an expedient found
afterwards to obviate the objection of an indecency in their Homage:
as it was also in the case of Ecclesiastics.” (3 Litt. Hist. Hen. 2.
p. 339.) <i>Skene</i> gives a reason for the rule as laid down by
<i>Glanville</i>: <i>because Homage especially concerns service in
war</i>, (de verb. sign. ad voc. homagium.) He also remarks, that
consecrated Bishops did no homage. The reason, says Cowell, may be all
one. (Interpreter) But Craig (Jus Feud. 1. 11. 10.) and the Regiam
Majestatem (L. 2. c. 60.) expressly coincide with our Author. Indeed,
if any doubt could possibly exist, concerning the unconditional
meaning of the passage in the text, it would be silenced by the
latter part of the present chapter. Having made use of the expression
<i><span lang="la">liber homo</span></i>, our author pointedly adds, <i><span lang="la">masculus</span></i>, as if
solicitous to prevent any possible misconception, especially that very
misconception Lord Coke seems to have fallen into, which is likewise
refuted by a custom mentioned by Lord Littleton. “From the obligation
laid on the Husband to do Homage for the wife, it naturally followed,
that the Barony of a wife, as well as every other Fief requiring
Homage, was in effect made over to the Husband; and, therefore, in
those days many Barons came to Parliament in right of their wives, and
by virtue of their marriage, were accounted Peers of the Realm. It
has been observed, in this History, that the same notion extended to
Dukedoms and Principalities in many parts of the Continent.” (Litt.
Hen. 2. p. 339.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_327" href="#FNanchor_327" class="label">[327]</a> We have observed, that homage was divided into,
<i>liege</i> and <i>feudal</i>: it was also divided into, <i>liege</i>
and <i>not liege</i>, which division corresponds with the other.
<i>Liege</i> is borrowed from the French, as Thaumas informs us. (Cout.
de Beauvoisis p. 255.) and seems to have meant a service that was
personal and inevitable. (Traités Sur Les Cout. Anglo-Norm. par Houard.

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_328" href="#FNanchor_328" class="label">[328]</a> In performing Homage, the Tenant was to name and specify

where the feudal Law was in use, with regard to their sovereigns, and,
the omission of that reserve was punished in England by a judicial
determination under Edward the first.” (3 Litt. Hen. 3. p. 111.) This

Fealty, <i>before they were consecrated</i>. This was confirmed by the
Constitutions of Clarendon, of which a particular account will be given
hereafter; and, from the words of Glanville, it appears, that about the
end of Henry the 2nd’s reign Homage was accordingly done by <i>Bishops
elect</i>, but he tells us, that <i>after they were consecrated</i>
they took the oath of fealty. This was a material difference from
what had been settled by the constitutions of Clarendon: and it is

to this identical chapter of Glanville, in support of the doctrine of
Homage Auncestrel!! (Co. Litt. 101. a.) The Reg. Maj. is rather more
consistent with itself, but assists us not materially. “But it is
otherwise to be understood of him who has Lands as free Heritage, for
the which he is <i>not</i> obliged to make Homage: for, although he

<p><a id="Footnote_343" href="#FNanchor_343" class="label">[343]</a> Fleta enumerates the instances in which Reliefs were not
to be paid. 1. None was payable for a Fief, acquired by any species of
purchase. 2. Nor on a change of the Lord. 3. Nor was a Tenant for life
only, to pay a Relief. 4. Nor any man who married a woman who had been
in custody—but this differs from the Text. 5. Nor any one from whom his
Lord had received a remuneration, on account of custody. 6. Nor any one
who had once paid a relief for his Estate. (Fleta L. 3. c. 17. s. 5. et

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_344" href="#FNanchor_344" class="label">[344]</a> Reliefs were in many parts of Normandy certain and
fixed: thus a Knight’s fee, or, as it is there termed, <i><span lang="la">feudum
loricæ</span></i> was five pounds, a barony one hundred pounds, land twelve
pence an acre, and woody ground 6d. (Grand Cust. c. 34.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_345" href="#FNanchor_345" class="label">[345]</a> Now, as a Knight’s fee was valued at £20, the sum

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_346" href="#FNanchor_346" class="label">[346]</a> It appears to have been thus settled by a Law of
the Conqueror. (LL. Gul. Conq. c. 40. Ed. Wilkins.) This, as Mr.
Watkins observes, seems to have been no more than accounting to the
Lord for the profits of that year, for which he might under certain
circumstances, have retained the Lands. (Treat. on Copyh. 1. 231.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_347" href="#FNanchor_347" class="label">[347]</a> Dr. Sullivan accounts for the advantage which the
Knights had obtained, when compared to the great Barons, in having
their Reliefs reduced to a certainty, from the number of the Knights
who made the strength of the Kingdom and were not to be disobliged; and
also from the precarious situation many of the great Lords were in, who
had been attached to the cause of Stephen. (Lectures p. 109.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_349" href="#FNanchor_349" class="label">[349]</a> This was remedied by Magna Carta cap. 2. The Reader may
consult Lord Coke’s comment on the words <i><span lang="la">antiquum relevium</span></i>,
where he endeavours to prove, the ancient Relief was certain. (2 Inst.
7. and 8.) Lord Coke, in support of his position, cites a MS. in the
Library of Archbishop Parker, which seems almost word for word to
coincide with the Laws of the Conqueror. (LL. Gul. Conq. c. 22. 23.
24.) This is the more remarkable, as his Lordship cites from a MS.
merely, without describing the nature of it.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_352" href="#FNanchor_352" class="label">[352]</a> Fleta tells us, that an examination ought to precede the
Homage, in order to ascertain, whether the person offering himself,
was the natural Son of the man to whom he made himself Heir, both with
respect to the right of possession, and of propriety &amp;c. &amp;c. that the
Lord might not inadvertently be deceived. (L. 3. c. 16. s. 23. 24.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_353" href="#FNanchor_353" class="label">[353]</a> The Reader will observe the expression, the King

into his hands. <i><span lang="la">In manum regis delapsa est</span></i> is the expression of
Dial. de Scacc. speaking of a fee held in chief, upon the death of its
owner. (L. 2. c. 10.) But a passage in Mr. Madox’s Hist. of the Excheq.
serves to throw still more light on the text. “Every Honor originally
passed from the King, and, upon every change, by death, or otherwise,
returned to the King again, and remained in his hand, until he
commanded seisin of it to be delivered to his Homager, according to the
custom of noble fiefs.” As the Law, by the magic of a fiction, cast the
Inheritance on the King the moment his Tenant <i><span lang="la">in Capite</span></i> died, it
was merely necessary for him to <i>retain</i> it—whilst the Law, not
interfering on behalf of an inferior Lord, obliged him to seise the
Land.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_354" href="#FNanchor_354" class="label">[354]</a> “Aids were, at first, benevolencies of the Vassals, and

Lord upon three occasions—to wit—when his Son was knighted, when his
Daughter was to be married, and when his person was to be ransomed:
but what originally flowed from regard, Superiors soon changed into a
matter of duty, and on a gratuity erected a right.” (Dalrymp. on feuds,
p. 52.)—Speaking of aids, Mr. Madox informs us, that King William
the First took 6s. of each Hyde through England—King Henry the First
took 3s. for each Hyde, as aid <i><span lang="fr">pur fille marier</span></i>. But he adds,
that, for want of requisite notices, he could not speak distinctly of
them. (Hist. Exch. c. 15. s. 1.) The Reader may also be referred to

says, that the word <i><span lang="la">contenementum</span></i> signifies the same with
<i>countenance</i>, as used by the country people, when intending to
receive a person with hospitality, they say—<i>I will see you with the

word occurs) is, a man shall not be so fined, but that he may be able

<p><a id="Footnote_357" href="#FNanchor_357" class="label">[357]</a> <i>Aid</i> and <i>relief</i> do not always appear to

mentioned in the present passage of the text, the Norman Code says,
<i><span lang="la">Hujusmodi relevia in quibusdam feodis dimidio relevio equalia: et in
quibusdam feodis decem solidos</span></i>. Hence, the ancient custom was to be
followed. (Le Grand Cust. de Norm. c. 35.) When Bracton wrote, these
aids were considered as matter of grace, rather than of right, being,
as he terms them, customs, not services, and personal to the Tenant,
not prædial. (36. b.) Judge Blackstone notices the great resemblance,
which, in the particular of aids, the Lord and Vassal of the Feudal
Law bore to the patron and client of the Roman Law: the patron being
entitled to three aids from his client, viz. to marry his Daughter, to
pay his Debts, and to redeem his person from captivity. (2 Com. 63.)

merely remark that in the reigns of William the Conqueror and his Son
Rufus, they were no less immoderate, than oppressive. Henry the First
was compelled, by the peculiar difficulties of his situation, to make
many concessions.—One of which was, that amercements should no longer
be assessed, as they had been in his Father’s and Brother’s reigns,
to the extent of the whole property of the offender, but should be
proportionate to the crime—<i><span lang="la">sicut retro a tempore patris mei et
fratris mei in tempore aliorum antecessorum meorum</span></i>. (LL. Hen. 1.
c. 1.) If these words mean any thing, they imply, that Henry merely
restored the Common Law, which his Father and Brother had violated. How
ill this concession was observed, we may conjecture, from its having
been felt necessary to make it part of the great charter. (See 2 Inst.

as Bishop Nicholson hastily did, that Glanville <i>apes</i>, as he
expresses it, the Roman Code. (Scotch Historical Library, 255.) This,
of all faults, is the least imputable to the venerable Glanville.—On

<p><a id="Footnote_375" href="#FNanchor_375" class="label">[375]</a> The Norman Code divides Pledges into, <i><span lang="la">simplices</span></i>,
and <i><span lang="la">debiti retinentes</span></i>. An example of the former kind is the
following—<i><span lang="la">Ego plegio A. quod reddat B. decem solidos</span></i>. The
effect of such a pledge was, that it ceased with the life of the
person entering into it, and descended not upon his Heirs. Neither was
there any difference, in this respect, if the pledge was given for the
appearance of another in any suit. With respect to the latter kind of
pledge, the Term was employed, when the person entering into it made
himself answerable for the Debt, and thus stood in the twofold capacity
of Debtor and pledge. The effect of this seems to have been, to release
the original Debtor, and to render the Representatives of the person
entering into it liable to answer it. (Le Grand Custum. de Norm. c. 60.
89. 90.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_376" href="#FNanchor_376" class="label">[376]</a> The same Rule is laid down in the Norman Code: but the
subject is there treated far more diffusely. It seems, by that Code,
to have been an obligation imposed upon the Homager, by his tenure, to
become pledge for his Lord’s Debts to the extent of a year’s Rent—to
become pledge for his person, if in prison—for his prosecuting a suit,
or appearing to it, &amp;c. &amp;c. (Grand Custum. c. 60.)</p>

the text. (c. 2. s. 24.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_379" href="#FNanchor_379" class="label">[379]</a> With this explanation the <span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span> (L. 3.

coincide—though it differs from that given by Littleton, and followed
by Coke, Craig, and Blackstone. (Co. Litt. 205. a. 2 Comm. Bl. 157.
Craig Jus Feud. L. 2. D. 6. s. 27.) What is the more remarkable, Lord
Coke expressly contrasts the <i><span lang="la">mortuum vadium</span></i> to the <i><span lang="la">vivum
vadium</span></i>. <i><span lang="la">Vivum autem dicitur vadium quia nonquam moritur ex
aliquâ parte quod ex suis proventibus acquiratur.</span></i> But assuredly,
if the term mortgage is to be collected from its forcible contrast to
these words, Glanville’s explanation is infinitely preferable to that
given by Lord Coke.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_380" href="#FNanchor_380" class="label">[380]</a> <i><span lang="la">Existente termino.</span></i> This is a palpably false
reading—it should be, <i><span lang="la">elapso termino</span></i>, the term being expired,
an expression familiar to Glanville. This suggestion is sanctioned
by the Reg. Maj. “<i>the day being bygone</i>,” (L. 3. c. 3.)—by the
expression of the text <i><span lang="la">ad terminum</span></i> in the sentence immediately
preceding—by the words of the Writ in the next chapter, “<i>a term
which is past</i>”—and, lastly, by a passage in the <a href="#BOOK10_CHAP_VIII">Eighth Chapter of
this Book</a>, where our Author expressly lays it down, that, before the
time fixed for payment, the Creditor cannot claim the Debt. Yet is the
reading <i><span lang="la">existente termino</span></i> preserved in Mr. Houard’s Edition of
Glanville, an Edition frequently, but not always, more correct than any
of those printed in this Country.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_381" href="#FNanchor_381" class="label">[381]</a> Sir Edward Coke, having been led by his subject to treat
of <i>conditions</i>, refers to the present Chapter of our Author.
From such plain and simple materials did the complicated doctrine of
conditions draw its primary principles!! (Co. Litt. 201. b.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_382" href="#FNanchor_382" class="label">[382]</a> “In Glanville’s time,” says Sir Wm. Blackstone, “when
the universal method of conveyance was by livery of seisin, or
corporeal tradition of the Lands, no gage or pledge of Lands was good,
unless possession was also delivered to the Creditor”—and, having
referred to this part of our Author, he observes, “And the frauds
which have arisen, since the exchange of these public and notorious
conveyances for more private and secret bargains, have well evinced the
wisdom of our ancient Law.” (2 Bl. Com. 159.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_383" href="#FNanchor_383" class="label">[383]</a> This may be accounted for by recollecting that
Usury itself, though viewed in a criminal light, was not expressly
prohibited. (Ante L. 7. c. 16.) Nor was it punished, if the party
amended: but, if he died in the crime, the act had then reached the
point of criminality—the offence was complete, and the punishment
followed. But, until that moment arrived, Usury, in strictness, was an
act rather approaching to a crime, than actually amounting to it. The
reasoning was founded upon principles no less artificial than false—the
death of the party being purely accidental, and the crime itself being
complete, without any reference to such accident, the very instant the
party received the usurious remuneration. The doctrine of the Regiam
Majestatem, in unison with this reasoning, and contrary to the text of
Glanville, expressly forbids a Mortgage, because it was a species of
Usury. (c. 5. L. 3.)</p>

<p>The Reader will meet with some curious disquisitions in the Dial. de
Scacc. (L. 2. s. 10.) where he will find the doctrine of the text
illustrated in the true spirit of the times.</p>

be returned, and not another of the same quantity or quality, as in a

these distinctions to Glanville; for they may, after all, be the result
of a much more recent period. Nor is the reading of Bracton, in the

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_410" href="#FNanchor_410" class="label">[410]</a> Sir Edward Coke ascribes this rule to “the policy of the

<p><a id="Footnote_411" href="#FNanchor_411" class="label">[411]</a> Mr. Madox, in treating of the <i>Exchequer</i>, informs
us, that “in general, accomptants were obliged to come in person to
render their accounts. If they made an Attorney to account for them, it
was usual to have the King’s leave for it. Sometimes, the accomptant
nominated his Attorney before the King: and thereupon the King by
his Writ commanded the Treasurer and Barons to admit such person, as
Attorney, accordingly. But sometimes, especially towards the latter
part of the second period, the Accomptant’s Attorney was admitted by
warrant or leave of the Treasurer, Chancellor of the Exchequer, or
Barons, or one of them.” (Madox’s Excheq. c. 23. s. 5.) Supposing there
was a certain uniformity of proceeding observed in the superior Courts,
this extract may furnish us with an idea of the gradual deviations from
the strict rule of our text.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_412" href="#FNanchor_412" class="label">[412]</a> The Norman Code lays down a contrary doctrine, asserting
that it was not lawful to constitute any Attorney in the absence of
the party, unless in the presence of the Prince, whose testimony alone
sufficed to make a Record. (Grand. Cust. c. 65.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_413" href="#FNanchor_413" class="label">[413]</a> <i><span lang="la">Ballivum</span></i>. It is the opinion of Sir Henry Spelman,
that we received the term from the Normans. There is, indeed, frequent
mention of such an officer in the Grand Custumary. (c. 4. &amp;c.) But
Lord Coke thinks, we received it from the Saxons. It occurs in a law
of Edward the Confessor, if it be not an interpolation of a later
age. (Ed. Conf. LL. c. 35.) It has been received in a variety of
significations—As meaning a Judge, an Officer of the Crown, a Bailiff
of a hundred, of a Liberty, and of a Borough, of a Manor and of an
Estate. (Spelm. Gloss. ad voc.) Cowell, who deduces the word from the
French, thinks our Sheriffs were formerly called Bailiffs, as their
Counties are termed Bailiwicks. (Cowell ad voc.) See Fleta L. 2.</p>

i.e. <i><span lang="la">familia</span></i>. We English it Steward.” (Cowell’s Interp. ad voc.
Seneshall. See also Madox’s Excheq. c. 3. s. 6.) “It is derived,”
says Lord Coke, “of <i><span lang="de">Sein</span></i> a house or place and <i><span lang="de">schalc</span></i>
an officer or governor, &amp;c.” (<span lang="la">Vide</span> Co. Litt. 61. a. for other

us, L. 13. c. 13. it seems perfectly clear, that a Bailiff was allowed
to hear a Recognition for his principal. The reason of the distinction,
perhaps, might be found in the different nature of the functions—to
perform the duty of an Attorney being an active, that of merely hearing
a Recognition, of a passive nature—the one, requiring skill—the other,
not.</p>

the Ancestor died seised. It seems, London and Oxford enjoyed these
Customs. (Bracton fo. 272.) Mr. Somner conceives, that the utility
aimed at by the Law in question and the foundation of it was, the good
of the Commonwealth, by the maintenance of traffic, which was much
encouraged by the liberty of a free devise, though this is somewhat
darkly pointed at, as he says, by Glanville in the present passage.

<i>ancient</i>, whilst, if the Disseisin were done since the last
Eyre, then it was a novel Disseisin. Bracton treats largely upon the
subject of novel Disseisin 160, et seq. See also 2 Inst. 24. The remedy
of novel Disseisin is also treated of in the Assises of Jerusalem,
with some peculiar provisions adapted to the singular circumstances
in which the Holy Land was situated, (c. 63. et seq.) The respectable
Translator of the Code Napoleon observes, that he has not met with the
term <i>novel disseisin</i> before Magna Carta.—Amidst the attention
of preparing his work for the press, he must have forgotten not only
Glanville, but the Mirror.—Whatever doubt maybe entertained respecting
the authority of the Mirror, yet Glanville indubitably proves, that the

Assises, I shall make no apology to the Reader for extracting the
following observations from Mr. Reeves’s highly valuable work. “It must
be observed of these <i>Assises</i> (for so they are sometimes called
by Glanville, but more commonly <i>Recognitions</i>) that they are not
all of the same kind; that <i><span lang="la">de morte antecessoris</span></i> being evidently
an original proceeding, independent of any other; the rest (not
excepting that <i><span lang="la">de ultimâ presentatione</span></i>, and that <i><span lang="la">utrum laicum
feodum vel ecclesiasticum</span></i>) being merely for the decision of facts
which arose in some original action or proceeding. Thus the writs for
summoning Recognitions of the latter kind were simple writs of Summons:
they mentioned that a Plea was depending in Court by the king’s writ;
and they were granted at the prayer of either party: so that they
seemed to be resorted to, by the assent of parties for settling an
incidental question, on which they put the dispute between them. On
the other hand, the writ <i><span lang="la">de morte antecessoris</span></i> has all the
appearance of an original commencement of a suit. It issued only upon
condition the Demandant gave security to prosecute it, <i><span lang="la">Si G. filius
T. fecerit te securum de clamore suo prosequendo, tunc summone</span></i>,
and made no mention of a plea depending. Of the same kind was the writ
<i><span lang="la">de novâ desseisinâ</span></i>.” (Reeves’s Hist. Eng. Law, 188.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_492" href="#FNanchor_492" class="label">[492]</a> When any one, says Bracton, speaking of the crime of
læse majesty, knows another to be guilty, he is instantly to apprise
the king, or one of his ministers. He should not abide in one place for
two nights nor two days; but disregarding every other affair, however
urgent, he should hasten to the king, scarcely daring to wait to look
behind him. (Bracton 118. b. See also Fleta L. 1. c. 21. 22. and Mirror
c. 8. s. 1.) In the latter Author, we find the following despotically
comprehensive definition.—“Treason is every mischief which a man
knowingly does or procures to be done to one he is in duty bound to be
a friend to.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_493" href="#FNanchor_493" class="label">[493]</a> This is a most singular part of the Code of the age when
Glanville lived. The obligation upon a man to defend himself, when
another starts forward to accuse him, seems the necessary result of
men living together in a state of society, and, as coeval with society
itself, is strongly enforced by the municipal Laws of every Nation.
This seems to have been the object of the punishment <i><span lang="fr">peine forte et
dure</span></i>. That singular institution shewed a strong, but rough, hand
in the Legislature, more capable of directing its laws to a good and
wise <i>end</i>, than nice or happy in selecting the <i>means</i>. The
proceeding was naturally abolished as the Law became more refined—more
humanized. As to the passage of our Author’s text now before us, it
receives some light from Bracton—a suggestion, for which I am indebted
to Mr. Reeves’s valuable work. Bracton speaks of an Indictment <i><span lang="la">per
famam patriæ</span></i>, which, in all probability, was the same proceeding
our Author alludes to. The foundation of that proceeding was a
presumption entertained by good and grave men who deserved credit,
and not the flying report of common conversation. (143. a.) But the
subject receives additional elucidation from the Norman Code. <i><span lang="la">In
criminalibus tamen manifestis seu notoriis maliciis quos famâ publicâ
seu fide dignorum testimonium nunciant culpabiles, non expectato Juris
ordine debent arrestari et carceribus mancipari.</span></i> (Grand Cust. c. 4.
and 68.) In Mr. Kelham’s translation of Britton’s Pleas of the Crown,
(page 18. Note 15.) the Reader will find the valuable record of an
Indictment on suspicion. The Reader may also be referred to Bracton
143.—LL. Hen. 1. c. 45.—Mirror c. 2. s. 22. and Fleta L. 1. c. 21.</p>

Treason, or of any felony whatsoever, was bailable, upon good security:
for at the Common Law the Gaol was his pledge or security that could
find none.” (2 Inst. 189.) This serves to elucidate the text, which
is obscure from its brevity. A similar explanation is given in the
progress of the present chapter, but is qualified, with the exception
of the plea of Homicide.</p>

true it may be, that the <i><span lang="la">lex apparens</span></i> was, in the general
sense of the expression, applied to the Duel. (Spelm. Gloss. ad voc.

have availed myself of the Translation of the <span lang="la">Regiam Majestatem</span>. “And,
if any man is condemned of that crime, his judgment and punishment of
his life and limbs depend only upon the king’s benefit and good will,

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_505" href="#FNanchor_505" class="label">[505]</a> The trial by <i>Ordeal</i>, the favorite offspring of
Superstition, has been by Fleury, Le Brun, and others, supposed to
be derived from the Ancients, because Pliny (L. 8. c. 2.) mentions a
family in Tuscany, upon whom the sacred fire, made in honor of Apollo,
had no effect. But M. Houard, with much more appearance of reason,
imagines, that it originated from the Miracles attributed by the
Christians to their Saints. (<i><span lang="fr">Traités sur les coutumes Anglo-Normand.
Tom.</span> 1. p. 577.</i>) However that may be, this mode of Trial existed
here so early as the Reign of Ina; and William the first found it in
use in this country, when he mounted the throne. His Normans, attached
by early habit to the Trial by Duel, rejected a mode of decision,
which appeared to them as a superstitious formality, though it was
still suffered to be resorted to by old and maimed men, and by women.
According to the Laws of Ina, the accused had <i>the choice</i> of the
Trial by fire, or that by water. If he preferred the former, an Iron
was prepared that weighed three pounds at the most. No person, except
the Priest, whose duty it was to preside on the occasion, entered the
Temple, after the fire destined to heat the Iron was kindled. The Iron
being placed upon the fire, two men posted themselves on each side of
the Iron, to determine upon the degree of heat it ought to possess. As
soon as they were agreed upon this point, the same number of men were
introduced <i><span lang="la">ab utroque latere</span></i>, and they also placed themselves at
the two extremities of the Iron. All these witnesses passed the night
fasting, &amp;c.</p>

<p>At day-break, the Priest, after sprinkling them with the holy-water,
and making them drink, presented them with the Book of the Evangelists
to kiss, and then crossed them. The Mass then began. From that moment,
the fire was no more increased: but the Iron was left on the embers,
until the last Collect. That finished, the Iron was raised, and the
most profound silence was observed, in praying the Deity to manifest
the truth. At this instant, the accused took the Iron into his hand,
and carried it to the distance of nine feet, <i><span lang="la">juxta mensuram pedum
ejus</span></i>. The Trial being ended, the hand of the accused was bound
up, and the bandage sealed; and, three days after, the hand was
examined, to ascertain whether it was or not <i>impure</i>, which M.
Houard, thus explains: <i><span lang="fr">ce qui doit, je crois, faire entendre que
l’on n’étoit pas coupable, quand la main conservoit des marques de
brûlure mais seulement lorsque la brûlure tomboit en supuration</span></i>.
(<i>ubi supra.</i>) But, if the accused elected the Trial by Water,
then, the Water was placed in a Vessel, and heated to the highest
degree. For inferior Crimes, the accused plunged his arm up to the
wrist: for crimes of deeper dye, he plunged it up to the Elbow. In
every other part of the ceremony, the two species of Trial by water and
fire agreed. (LL. Inæ c. 77.) The Mirror coincides with the text of
Glanville, (c. 3. s. 23.) and Lord Hale informs us, “that in all the
time of King John the purgation <i><span lang="la">per ignem et aquam</span></i>, or the Trial
by <i>Ordeal</i>, continued, as appears by frequent Entries upon the
Rolls; but, it seems to have ended with this king, for I do not find it
in use in any time after.” (Hist. Com. Law. 152.)</p>

all the rest, whom he last took to wife; and the reason thereof is,
because it belongeth not to the Temporal Court to try who was his wife
of right, and which, in fact, and the appeals of all others are to be

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_516" href="#FNanchor_516" class="label">[516]</a> Lord Coke, in two instances, cites the present
chapter of Glanville as one of the authorities on which he founds
his assertion, that previously to the Great Charter a woman, as well
as a man, might have had an appeal of the death <i>of any of her
Ancestors</i>. (Co. Litt. 25. b. and 2 Inst. 68.) It is impossible to
conceive how Glanville corroborates this bold position. He is a very
strong authority for the contrary doctrine, and excludes expressly
in this chapter and by relation in the <a href="#BOOK14_CHAP_I">first chapter of the present
Book</a>, a woman’s right of appeal in every instance, except that of the
death of her Husband, and that of a personal injury. <i>Bracton</i>
also in the most decided language confines a woman’s right of appeal
to these two instances. (fo. 125, and 148.) Great as Lord Coke is, his
deductions and citations from the more ancient writers are not by any
means implicitly to be relied upon. His name has thrown a lustre over
many an error. Nothing would be more easy than to adduce innumerable
instances in support of the truth of this assertion.</p>

goods are taken as it were <i><span lang="fr">de la robe</span></i>, from the Robe, that is
from the person. (Co. Litt. 288. a. and 3. Inst. 67.) Cowell deduces
the term from the French <i><span lang="fr">robbe</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">vestis</span></i>, and Spelman
from <i>raubas</i>, meaning the same thing. The Saxons used their
term <i>reaferar</i> in a similar sense, <i>reaf</i> signifying,
<i><span lang="la">vestis</span></i>. For Travellers had in former times rarely any thing
but their dress of which they could be robbed. (See Cowell and Spelm.

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
